               Guidelines for adding drivers to PrintMaster


The basic steps to add a driver are:


1. Create the driver procedure in PRINTMASTER>REBUILD>L3 using existing
   drivers in L3 as a guide.

2. Modify CUSTOM_DRIVERS.CPL in REBUILD so that the new drivers will be
   loaded.

3. Compile the driver procedure with SPL.  This Prime PL/I compiler is
   located in the INDEX directory on the master release tapes if not
   already installed on your system.
      For production compiles, we use: -QUICK -NO_COPY -OPT
      For debugging, we use: -DEBUG -RANGE -NOOPT

4. Run CUSTOM_DRIVERS.CPL to create the CUSTOM_DRIVERS.RUN EPF library.

5. Use CDD to create a device definition for the new device driver

6. Start new device to test driver


Directories in PRINTMASTER>REBUILD:
----------------------------------


BIN
---
Any new routines or routines where source has been supplied may be
compiled into this directory.  CUSTOM_DRIVERS.CPL loads from here.


L2
--
Source files for the standard line-oriented level 2 driver procedures.


L3
--
Source files for the standard line-oriented level 3 drivers.  Use these
as models for creating new drivers.


ENTRY
-----
Contains insert files defining entry points and external data structures.


INSERT
------
Contains insert files defining PrintMaster data structures, keys,
constants, etc.
