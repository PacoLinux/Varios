The following changes have been made in version 2.1:

o   Attempts to advance a device past the end of the print file cause
    an error message to be printed (on the device); printing resumes
    at the top of the last page printed.

o   When a keyword file is printed on the terminal in text format,
    printing will pause every 20 lines.  The pause is disabled if
    a command file is active.

o   Additional information has been added to the device status
    display:
      .  Pending commands and actions
      .  Advance target page
      .  Device statistics have been corrected

o   Form feeds in NO_FORMAT mode now work correctly

o   Stack dumps are no longer printed when a program is run and the
    system is not initialized.
