The following changes have been made in version 5.0.4:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


*** There is an update procedure for version 5.0.4!  After running
*** INSTALL_PRINTMASTER and INIT_PRINTMASTER, the system administrator
*** should run PRINTMASTER>UPD>UPD5.0.4.CPL to add new keywords to the
*** master keyword file.


                           G E N E R A L

    o    CPL procedures will now take responses from command files.
         Previously, it was impossible to write a CPL program that
         would create device drivers using CDD, because CDD always
         used the -TTY option for the [RESPONSE] command function.

    o    A new keyword, -JOB_EDIT has been added.  It can be
         placed only on jobs, and specifies a dynamically-linked
         procedure to call before adding jobs to the print queues.
         The procedure is called with two arguments: a pointer to
         the job keyword list, and an error string that the routine
         may set if the job should not be queued.  If it is okay to
         queue the job, the procedure should return PL/I true
         ('1'b, -32768, :100000); otherwise, it should set the error
         string and return PL/I false ('0'b or zero).  This procedure
         will be called when jobs are queued with APJ or SPOOL$, or
         changed with CPJ.

    o    APJ was printing a file size of 32767 for jobs queued with
         -OPEN.  The size is no longer printed.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    A new keyword, -PAGINATE has been added.  It can be placed
         on either jobs or devices, and specifies the number of
         lines to print per page in paged mode.  This is not the
         same as the physical number of lines, -LINES_PER_PAGE.
         The second value is optional, and specifies the maximum
         width of the paged mode header line.  This can be changed
         to affect the position of the "Page #" part of the header.

    o    A new option, -NO_EJECT, can be added to devices and jobs.
         If this keyword is present, the device will not do a form feed
         after printing a job.  This can be useful with sheet feeders
         if other software (typically word processing) is already
         performing the last form feed.

    o    The Versatec I/O routine was causing an extra linefeed on
         blank lines (affects drivers assigning PLOT device only).


                           M O N I T O R

    o    A bug in the monitor would cause messages to devices (as in
         DC xxx -STATUS) to get lost if the devices was in the process
         of timing out.

    o    Some additional error logging has been put in the monitor.

    o    The monitor would sometimes think a bunch of devices had
         shutdown if networks were in use.  The device would still
         be logged in however.
