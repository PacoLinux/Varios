The following changes have been made in version 4.7:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

**  o    Support for 19.1 and lower revs of Primos has been removed.
         Although PrintMaster runs on a 19.4 system, it does not take
         full advantage of the new features available, and because of
         the difference in the 19.4 and pre-19.4 environment, support
         for pre-19.4 systems will be gradually removed.  This will
         allow customers to use the dynamic linking mechanism to create
         their own drivers, accounting procedures, etc., without
         having to reload PrintMaster.

**  o    The static mode version of PrintMaster is no longer available
         since support was removed for 19.1 and lower rev systems.

**  o    Previously, PrintMaster used numbered semaphores -32 and -31
         to coordinate processes.  However, semaphore -32 is used by
         the Prime spooler.  To prevent a conflict, the default
         semaphores have been changed to -18 and -17.  Verify that
         these semaphores are not being used with the STAT SEM
         command on the system console.

    o    For systems running 19.3 or 19.4, Primos error text is not
         stored in a shared PrintMaster segment, as it was previously,
         since these versions of Primos supply a routine to return
         error text (ERTXT$).  This saves about 7 pages of memory.
         Systems running 19.2 will still incur the overhead.


                    K E Y W O R D   S Y S T E M

    o    If a keyword write protect error occured due to keywords
         in the global variable .APJ_DEFAULTS during the APJ
         command, an exteraneous error message about a condition
         KWL$COND_CONT_CONVERSION being signalled from ERR$ was
         printed, followed by the correct error that a keyword
         could not be overwritten.  This exteraneous message is
         no longer printed.


           X E R O X  2 7 0 0 - I I  D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    The Xerox 2700 driver, L3$X2700, has been changed so that
         it does not cause status sheets between all jobs on the
         3700 model.  This is caused by an incompatibility in the 3700.
         As a result of the change, if an error occurs during the
         job that causes a status sheet to be printed, the job comment
         field will not contain the name and job number of the job
         as it previously did.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    The monitor program now gracefully handles network shutdowns
         that can occur using STOP_NET at 19.3 and above.  Local printers
         will continue to print local jobs, and will resume printing
         remote jobs when the network is started back up.  Previously,
         stopping the network caused the monitor to logout.

    o    A problem exists in the network library, VFTNLB, which sometimes
         caused the monitor to abort with an ACCESS_VIOLATION$ condition.
         This occurred because constants are coded in VFTNLB in places
         where variables should be used.  A special version of VFTNLB is
         included with the PrintMaster release tapes which fixes the
         problem.

    o    Jobs queued at priority zero are supposed to be printed first-
         in-first-out.  This worked correctly unless the monitor was
         shutdown and restarted, in which case priority zero jobs would
         print in order by their job number.  The monitor will now
         sort priority zero jobs by their date queued when initially
         loading a queue from disk.
