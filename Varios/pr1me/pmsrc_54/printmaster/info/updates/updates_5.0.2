The following changes have been made in version 5.0.2:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


*** There is an update procedure for version 5.0.2!  After running
*** INSTALL_PRINTMASTER and INIT_PRINTMASTER, the system administrator
*** should run PRINTMASTER>UPD>UPD5.0.2.CPL to add new keywords to the
*** master keyword file.


                  I N I T   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    The option -PACL did not work on rev 19.4.9 systems and above.
         It caused an Primos illegal treename error.


                     A D D   P R I N T   J O B

    o    APJ now prints the file size as does the Prime spooler for
         compatibility.


                    D E V I C E   C O M M A N D

    o    DC was only printing 4 characters of the device's version
         number; in "dot dot" revs, the version number is 6 chars.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    The driver was not always cleaning up jobs when force logged
         out, nor when the break key was hit from the TTY driver.

    o    Four new keywords are recognized by the device driver:

             -DEVICE_INIT_STRING
             -DEVICE_TERMINATE_STRING

         These keywords can be placed on a device only.  If they have
         values, the value string is sent to the device during
         initialization and termination (startup and shutdown),
         respectively.  This is useful to initially setup a device,
         and to reset it to a clean state before it shuts down.


             -JOB_INIT_STRING
             -JOB_TERMINATE_STRING

         These keywords can be placed on both jobs and devices.  The
         value string is sent to the device just before a job starts
         and after it ends, respectively.  Before a job is printed,
         the init string from -JOB_INIT_STRING on the device is sent,
         then the init string from -JOB_INIT_STRING on the user's job.
         After the job has printed, the user's terminate string is
         sent followed by the device's terminate string.


                  L I S T   P R I N T   Q U E U E

    o    LPQ was not printing "n" under the options field if a job
         was queued with a note to the operator.
