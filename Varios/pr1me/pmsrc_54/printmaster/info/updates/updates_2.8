The following changes have been made in version 2.8:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

***      Two keywords must be added to the master keyword file:
***      -JOB_SIZE_LIMIT:i and -DEVICE_SPEED:i

***      The ACL on PRINTMASTER* should be modified so that SYSTEM
***      has ALL access rather than DALURW.

    o    The long form of all commands has been removed, since they
         were seldom used and cluttered up system directories.

    o    Keyword and text backup files are no longer created by CDD,
         CPD and CFD.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    There was a bug in the monitor causing it to crash with an
         ACCESS_VIOLATION$ condition.  This only occurred when more
         than one monitor was started on a network.


                  L I S T   P R I N T   Q U E U E

    o    LPQ was speeded up by 20-25%.


                  C H A N G E   P R I N T   J O B

    o    When an operator changes a job that he did not spool, he
         is asked for verification unless the -NQ option is used.


                  D E L E T E   P R I N T   J O B

    o    When an operator deletes a job that he did not spool, he
         is asked for verification unless the -NQ option is used.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    EVFU support has been added (form length only) for parallel
         Printronix and Data Printer (band) printers.

    o    A new device keyword, -JOB_SIZE_LIMIT controls the maximum
         job size (in disk records) a device will print.  This is
         similiar to Prime PROP's LIMIT parameter.

    o    A new device keyword, -DEVICE_SPEED will be added on all
         devices created with version 2.8 and beyond.  This will be
         used in the future to schedule faster printers before the
         slower ones.

    o    The maximum print line length has been increased from 256 to
         500 characters.

    o    The generic AMLC driver was halting with a coding error
         "Attempt to skip more than 1 page".


               I N S T A L L   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    The user-id SYSTEM now has ALL access to the system
         directory,  PRINTMASTER*, rather than DALURW.  This was
         changed because SYSTEM could not be made an operator.

    o    Programs in CMDNC0 and PRINTMASTER* are always replaced as
         a unit; it is no longer possible to replace only the commands
         since PrintMaster is shared.
