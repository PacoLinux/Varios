The following changes have been made in version 5.3:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    Formerly, a line skip was performed after printing a line in
         no format mode UNLESS the line ended in a carriage return.
         Now, a line skip is also not performed if the line ends with
         a form feed ('14 or '214).  This prevents a problem with
         paper "crawling" down 1 line when a file ending with a form
         feed, is spooled with -NO_EJECT and -NO_FORMAT, on a device
         with -EVFU.


                   L I S T   P R I N T   Q U E U E

    o    LPQ was only listing jobs with a job-id less than 1024.
         Now, all jobs will be shown regardless of the job number.
         (Steve - I don't imagine this fix will apply to many users
         except you!)


                           M O N I T O R

    o    At rev 21, Primos allows up to 238 partitions.  Previously,
         PrintMaster only allowed 64, and bombed if more were added.
         Now, PrintMaster allows 128 partitions, and will not halt
         if more are added, although the additional partitions will
         not be scanned for queues.
