The following changes have been made in version 3.1:

with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

    o    PrintMaster did not run with Primos rev 19.1 due to
         bugs in the 19.1 version of CL$PIX.  The typical symptom
         of this problem was some kind of error specifying the
         string "''".  Allowances have been made for this.

    o    A problem with SRCH$$ was causing the queue verify
         procedure to terminate before all queue entries had
         been read.  Trashed entries were also not being
         deleted.


                  I N I T   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    INIT_PRINTMASTER would hang after the message "Shared
         segments initialized" if the -FULL option was used and
         the system had already been initialized.
