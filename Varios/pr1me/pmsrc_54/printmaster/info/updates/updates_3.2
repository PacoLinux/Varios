The following changes have been made in version 3.2:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

*** o    A CPL procedure called UPD3.2 should be run after version
***      3.2 has been loaded and initialized.


                        U S E R   H O O K S

    o    Two user hooks have been added to allow sites to customize
         PrintMaster in well-defined ways.  These are procedures
         called at "interesting" points, and can change job keyword
         lists, affect job scheduling, etc.  One hook is called
         just before a job is added or changed, and the other during
         the job scheduling function.  See source files in directory
         HOOK for details.


                     A D D   P R I N T   J O B

    o    Segment directories in the print queue are now extended in
         multiples of 512; this reduces the number of file system
         calls without increasing storage space requirements.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    The device driver was halting with a coding error when a job
         attempted to skip to an illegal channel.  Now the device
         drops the job.

    o    The device driver now accepts the keyword -PARITY.  It has
         the following form:

              -PARITY ON or OFF or FLIP or SAME

         All characters sent to the device will have the parity bit
         (bit 8) set to 1, set to 0, reversed, or unchanged.  If this
         keyword is omitted, parity will remain unchanged.

*** o    A device driver was written for the Xerox 2700-II laser
***      printer and many new keywords were added to support its
***      features. (This is described in detail in another document.)

    o    The job accounting file is now created as a DAM file to allow
         fast position to the end when an accounting record is added.

    o    The names of the level 2 and level 3 device drivers have been
         changed in this release.  After installing version 3.2, attach
         to PRINTMASTER and run FIX3.2.  This will change the drivers
         for all existing devices.

    o    All values of keywords are printed on the banner page.
         Previously only 1 value was printed.


                    K E Y W O R D   S Y S T E M

    o    If negative numbers were used as keyword values, they were
         being interpreted as keywords and an error message was
         printed that the keyword was invalid.

    o    If a keyword list is printed on the terminal in text format,
         keywords with multiple values will have the first value
         printed on the line after the keyword rather than on the same
         line.  Values are also indented from their keywords.

    o    An keyword abbreviation facility has been added.  These are
         created by the System Administrator and are expanded for all
         keywords on the command line only.  Abbreviations are stored
         in the master keyword file with the :A flag.  The keyword
         value is the expansion, and must be a valid keyword.
***      Some abbreviations are included in this release, but must
***      be added by the Administrator at installed sites:

               -CF     -COPYFILE              -AS   -JOB_NAME
               -SB     -SINGLE_BANNER         -LN   -LINE_NUMBERS
               -NH     -NO_HEADER             -PH   -PAGE_HEADER
               -NF     -NO_FORMAT             -CP   -COPIES


                S P O O L $   R E P L A C E M E N T

    o    Prime's SPOOL$ subroutine accepts a pathname of any length if
         the key is 1 (copy file to queue).  This is an undocumented
         feature, but has been included in PrintMaster's SPOOL$
         replacement for compatibility.


                  L I S T   P R I N T   Q U E U E

    o    Job sizes were not being computed properly.  Jobs with less
         than 513 words were printed with a size of zero.  The sizing
         algorithm was also different than the one used in APJ.  Both
         have been changed so that empty jobs have size zero, jobs
         with less than 512 words have size 1, and all others are
         rounded up or down to the nearest disk record.


                 C R E A T E   D E V I C E   D E F

    o    CDD has been modified to allow creation of devices using
         non-standard drivers and keywords.

    o    Device automatic shutdown after idle is now a per-device
         characteristic rather than a system-wide default.  Note:
***      Sites with earlier verions may want to remove this keyword
***      (-TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN) from the system device default
***      keyword file (PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>DEVICE_DEFAULTS.KF).

    o    A new option has been added that causes devices to chop off
         lines that exceed the paper width (value of -CHARS_PER_LINE).
         This was always being done in previous releases, but some new
         devices can change the line width and require no truncation.
***      To cause truncation on existing devices, add the keyword
***      -TRUNCATE to the device definition.


                 E D I T   K E Y W O R D   F I L E

    o    The keyword file editor has been modified so that editing in
         the text command loop and editing from keywords on the EKF
         command line are independent of whether a new keyword file is
         being created or an old one is being modified.  Formerly the
         text command loop was entered only when a new keyword list
         was created, and a new keyword list could not be created from
         keywords on the command line.  Also, EKF with no command
         options is now interpreted as an implied -LIST.

    o    If the master keyword file was editing using a pathname
         rather than the -MASTER option, EKF did not reload the
         internal version of the master list in the shared segment.
         The change did not have any effect until the next system
         initialization.  The master list is now reloaded anytime it
         is edited, with the exception of editing a remote master keyword
         file.  In this case, EKF will NOT reload the master list
         (since it resides in a shared segment on the remote system).
         EKF must be run ON THE REMOTE SYSTEM to cause the new master
         list to be reloaded.
