The following changes have been made in version 3.7:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

***      Don't forget to run the UPD programs for all revisions prior
***      to your current rev.  These are located in the ufd PRINTMASTER>UPD.

    o    Previously, the system console was considered an operator,
         but not phantoms submitted from the console.  Since it is
         not possible to set groups on phantoms submitted from the
         console, any user logged in under the id SYSTEM is now
         considered an operator.


                 S P O O L   R E P L A C E M E N T

    o    SPOOL$ now upcases the values of -FORM and -AT, as the
         Prime spooler did.


                 X E R O X   2 7 0 0   D R I V E R

    o    The -MERGE option now only reloads the constant page when
         it changes, rather than before each job.  Also, in earlier
         versions, -MERGE on a job with no value turned on merging
         even if the device had no -MERGE keyword (and no merge
         filename).  Since this doesn't really make sense, merging
         is now enabled if the job has -MERGE with a value, or if the
         job has -MERGE with no value and the device has -MERGE with
         a value.

    o    The constant page is unloaded from PCRAM whenever merging is
         not used.


                  L I S T   P R I N T   Q U E U E

    o    LPQ was holding the print queues open while sizing jobs
         queued with -OPEN, possibly aggravating the monitor problem
         below.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    The monitor checks jobs queued with -OPEN once every minute
         to see if they have been closed.  If the queue happened to
         be in use when the monitor tried to open it in this case,
         it stopped the scan prematurely without waiting for the
         queue to be closed.  It did not attempt to check for closed
         jobs for another minute.  Now, if the queue is in use, the
         scan is aborted, but will be attempted again in 5 seconds
         rather than 60.  This MAY improve turnaround time on
         jobs queued with -OPEN.

    o    Previously, the monitor also checked all jobs queued with
         -OPEN every time a new job was queued.  If five jobs were
         queued in succession, all open jobs were checked five times.
         Now, open jobs are only checked once every 60 seconds.

    o    Device states were being set incorrectly when timed-out
         devices were started.  The states eventually corrected
         themselves under normal circumstances.
