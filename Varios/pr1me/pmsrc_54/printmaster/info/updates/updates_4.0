    o    Previously, the SPOOL replacement command accepted only the
         options accepted by the Prime SPOOL command.  At version 4.0,
         it will accept all Prime options AND all PrintMaster APJ
         options.  This may make migration easier by allowing
         administrators to treat PrintMaster features as extensions
         to the Prime SPOOL command.  For example, the command:

              SPOOL MYFILE -FTN -FONT Titan10 -PR 10 -AT XEROX -FORM WHITE

         would queue a job to be printed on a Xerox laser printer in
         the Titan10 font, in FTN format, on form type WHITE, at priority 10.

    o    Support for rev 19.4 SPOOL$ features has been added.  The major
         changes are two new keys, 3 = MODIFY & 4 = CLOSE.  The SPOOL
         and PROP replacement command DO NOT yet support the new 19.4
         options.

    o    Use of the SPOOL options -NOeJect, -EXPand, -COBol, -HOMe and
         -FUNit no longer cause an error; a warning is now printed and
         the job is queued.

    o    The abbreviations for -NOJ, -N and -NO, were being
         incorrectly treated as abbreviations for -NOH.
