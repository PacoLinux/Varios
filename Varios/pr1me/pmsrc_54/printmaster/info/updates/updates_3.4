The following changes have been made in version 3.4:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

*** o    A CPL procedure called UPD3.4 should be run after version 3.4
***      has been loaded and initialized.  Don't forget to run the UPD
***      programs for all revisions prior to your current rev.  These
***      are located in the ufd PRINTMASTER>UPD.  See Loading Tape
***      Info for more information.

    o    All commands have been changed to EPF's.

    o    PrintMaster now requires the use of only three shared
         segments (by default, 2301 through 2303).

    o    The method for determining whether a site was at Phase I or
         Phase II has been changed.  In earlier versions, Phase II was
         indicated by the presence of the backup copies of Prime's
         PROP and SPOOL command (PROP.PRIME_VERSION.SAVE and
         SPOOL.PRIME_VERSION.SAVE) in CMDNC0.  Now it is indicated by
         the presence of PHASE-II in PRINTMASTER*.  This allows the
         backup files to be to be deleted from CMDNC0 without
         affecting the operation of the PrintMaster system.  However,
         if these files are deleted you cannot go back to Phase I
         (without doing a lot of typing).

    o    There is now a new procedure for rebuilding the system.  See
         PRINTMASTER>REBUILD>REBUILD.INFO for details.

    o    The problem with the monitor and device using large amounts
         of memory has been traced to an SPL bug that caused the
         heap to become fragmented.  SPL 19.3 does not free temporaries
         allocated to evaluate a SELECT statement with a string of
         non-constant extent as an argument IFF the argument matches any
         WHEN clause.

    o    Some CPL programs sometimes gave strange "access check" error
         messages.  This has been corrected.


                     A D D   P R I N T   J O B

    o    Users can now put job defaults in global variables.  These
         are loaded after the user default keyword file.  The global
         variable is named .APJ_USER_DEFAULTS, and it should be set
         to a keyword list in command line format.  These are
         overridden by keywords specified on the APJ command line, as
         usual.


                  C H A N G E   P R I N T   J O B

    o    Project id's are no longer checked to see if a user owns the
         job.  When an operator changes the job of another user,
         descriptive information is now printed about the job before
         the operator is asked for verification.

    o    If multiple jobs were changed with one CPJ command, the user
         was an operator, he was changing a job that didn't belong to
         him, and he decided not to change it when asked for verification,
         the next job changed would give an error message that -USER was
         a protected keyword.

    o    The -JOB keyword can be omitted.  The list of jobs to change
         should immediately follow the CPJ command, e.g.:
              OK, CPJ 14 3 21 -FORM TRASH


                  D E L E T E   P R I N T   J O B

    o    Project id's are no longer checked to see if a user owns the
         job.  When an operator changes the job of another user,
         descriptive information is now printed about the job before
         the operator is asked for verification.

    o    The -JOB keyword can be omitted.  The list of jobs to delete
         should immediately follow the DPJ command, e.g., DPJ 14 3 21


                    D E V I C E   C O M M A N D

    o    Both forms of relative positioning using the -POSITION
         command now work correctly.  DC PR0 -POSITION +5  is
         no longer taken as a +5 wildcard.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    If the -BANNER keyword was used on a device, the banner
         message was printed even if the user suppressed it with
         -NO_BANNER.  Now, only the user banner message is printed
         if -NO_BANNER is used.

    o    The Versatec/Gould driver L3$VG double spaced all output.


                  E D I T  K E Y W O R D  F I L E

    o    EKF now assumes -EDIT if keywords are given on the command
         line and no command option is given.


                  I N I T   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    If the monitor took longer than 30 seconds to start,
         INIT_PRINTMASTER would time-out and say that the monitor
         aborted.  Now, it will wait as long as is necessary for the
         monitor to either startup or logout.


               I N S T A L L   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    Changes were made to support EPF's and the Phase II changes.
         Some questions were moved to CONFIGURE_PRINTMASTER.


                    K E Y W O R D   S Y S T E M

    o    A bug in the procedure that destroys keyword lists would
         sometimes cause ERROR to be raised with a free of an
         already free item if the procedure was interrupted (e.g.
         with a break).


                    L I S T   P R I N T   J O B

    o    When the -LIST option was used, the text keyword file was
         being created in the queue if a pathname was not used.  The
         file is now created in the current directory.

    o    When the value for the -JOB option was omitted an incorrect
         error message was being printed.

    o    The -JOB keyword can now be omitted.  The job id should
         follow immediately after LPJ, e.g.,   LPJ 10


                           M O N I T O R

    o    Priority zero jobs ARE always printed first-in-first-out, but
         this is difficult to keep track of if the jobs are being
         changed.  Each time a priority zero job is changed, it is
         queued to the end of the queue.

    o    Before when an INIT_PRINTMASTER -FULL command was given and
         the monitor was running, the monitor would remain running,
         but all commands thought the monitor was down.  Now, the
         monitor will eventually reset itself (assuming that it
         survives the INIT_PRINTMASTER).   The monitor should always
         be logged out before a full init is performed.


                 R E M O V E   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    Changes were made to support EPF's and the Phase II changes.


                 S P O O L   R E P L A C E M E N T

    o    The SPOOL command used to bomb if unrecognized -LIST options
         were used.  Now they're just ignored (EX:   SPOOL -LIST YOURS)

    o    The -CANCEL option only worked with numeric job identifiers.
         Now the old PRTxxx form can also be used.

    o    SPOOL$ didn't work if the key was 1 (copy the file) and
         the caller was not written in either SPL or PL/I.

    o    SPOOL$ didn't work if the key was 1, a file name was given
         and you were not attached to your home directory.  This caused
         a file not found error.


                        U S E R   H O O K S

    o    One of the examples has been changed in the procedure
         HOOK$EDIT_JOB_BEFORE_QUEUED; it was incorrect.


                      X E R O X   D R I V E R

    o    If the keyword -HEX was used on a device, it did not cause
         any hex output.  It will now cause all job output to be
         printed in hex as stated in the documentation.

    o    A comment line is now printed on the job status sheet if an
         error occurs during printing (such as error 22 - line too
         long).  This can be used to identify which job owns the
         status sheet.

    o    A new keyword -MERGE has been added to the master keyword
         file to allow constant page loading.  See the Xerox info file
         for details.
