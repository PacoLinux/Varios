    o    CDD has been changed so that the idle timeout can be
         specified, rather than always defaulting to 10 minutes.

    o    Devices no longer truncate lines by default.  This must be
         explicitly requested when the device is created.

    o    A comma was deleted by accident at version 3.5, causing the
         CFD command to always fail with a CPL error.


                  C H A N G E   P R I N T   J O B

    o    CPJ was using a SGDR$$ call to go to the end of the segdir
         to determine if the number of copies was being changed.
         A bug in 19.4.0 and 19.4.1 Primos causes segdirs to have an
         extra entry, which confused CPJ.  The SGDR$$ call was
         replaced with another method of determining the number of
         copies.

    o    A device driver was added for the HP LaserJet printer.  At
         this rev it is identical to the AMLC driver.  Enhancements
         will be made at a later revision to support all LaserJet
         functions.  The driver name is L3$LASERJET.  The keyword
         -PARITY OFF or -PARITY FLIP should be used with this device.
