The following changes have been made in version 2.6:



                           G E N E R A L

o   PrintMaster was completely shared at rev 2.5, but if any of the
    commands were used BEFORE the system was initialized, they bombed
    with an ILLEGAL_SEGNO$ condition.  Now, the commands will print
    the error message that the system is not initialized, as they used
    to.

o   Before this version, a PrintMaster priority ACL was required on
    all partitions, now one is only required when print files on a
    partition are queued without -COPYFILE.


                            S P O O L $

o   The SPL shared library was not always being initialized, causing
    spurious ACCESS_VIOLATION$ conditions in segment 13.  The problem
    occurred in programs calling SPOOL$ directly, and would not occur
    if any PrintMaster command was run before calling SPOOL$.


                  L I S T   P R I N T   Q U E U E

o   A new option has been added, -SJ, to select only certain jobs
    to list.  It is followed by the list of keywords to "match"
    on.  For example:

         lpq -sj -form white black -at here there

    This command would list all jobs on form WHITE or BLACK, and
    destination HERE or THERE.  If the keywords -USER, -PROJECT,
    or -SYSTEM are specified without values, the current user's
    information is assumed.


                  I N I T   P R I N T M A S T E R

o   The order of some commands was changed to prevent having an
    invalid shared library entry when segment 2302 was reloaded
    with a new version of PrintMaster.

o   Some options have been added in this CPL program to allow
    sites to change the default Primenet port, maximum time to
    wait for a resource in use (such as an open file), and the
    semaphores used for process coordination.

o   A bug was fix that caused jobs to be deleted when the system was
    first started.  One job at the end of the queue was deleted for
    every "hole" in the queue (e.g., if jobs 1 2 3 7 8 9 were in the
    queue and the system was reinitialized, jobs 6, 7, 8, and 9 would
    have been deleted by mistake.)

o   A few changes were made to reorder messages appearing when the
    system is booted.


                  C H A N G E   P R I N T   J O B

o   If CPJ was used with no options or a bad command line, trash was
    being printed in the error message.
