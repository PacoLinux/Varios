The following changes have been made in version 2.7:




                  I N I T   P R I N T M A S T E R

o   The default semaphores have been changed from -1 and -2 to -31 and -32
    because of a conflict with Prime Information.

o   Command now accepts the option -PACL.  PrintMaster priority ACL's
    will not be set unless this option is used.

*** This option MUST be added to the INIT_PRINTMASTER command in
*** your system startup file if print files are queued without
*** -COPYFILE.

o   Previously when the monitor read a queue (usually during startup)
    it would delete any job that had extra files, such as a print file
    in both the UPDT and EXCL queue.  Now, an attempt is made to
    correct the problem rather than completely deleting the job.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

o   Print files in PJ_EXCL and PJ_UPDT queue segdirs were not being
    deleted when a job completed.  The next job would overwrite the
    data however, and the entries were also being deleted whenever
    the system was initialized, so the only symptom of the problem
    was a loss of disk space.

o   The device no longer leaves a copy marked printing on an error
    opening a job.

o   The standard accounting procedure, PS$ACCOUNTING, has been changed
    to append the first value of the optional job keyword -ACCT_INFO
    to the end of the accounting record.  This may be used to pass on
    additional information to your paper accounting system.

*** The keyword -ACCT_INFO must be added to you master keyword file
*** before this option may be used.  This must be an information (:i)
*** keyword.


                     A D D   P R I N T   J O B

o   Before this version, a PrintMaster priority ACL was required on
    all partitions, now one is only required when print files on a
    partition are queued without -COPYFILE.

o   If job is queued without -COPYFILE from a partition without a
    PrintMaster priority ACL, a warning is printed.
