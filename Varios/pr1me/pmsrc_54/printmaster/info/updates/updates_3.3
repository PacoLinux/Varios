The following changes have been made in version 3.3:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

*** o    A CPL procedure called UPD3.3 should be run after version
***      3.3 has been loaded and initialized.  Don't forget to run
***      the UPD programs for all revisions prior to your current
***      rev.  These are located in the ufd PRINTMASTER>UPD.

    o    The directory COMMON has been deleted from the release tapes.
         The insert files that were in COMMON have been moved to
         INSERT and ENTRY.

    o    Dynamic segments are now used for heap storage allocation
         rather than segments '4010 - '4027.  This permits the SPOOL$
         replacement procedure to be used with INFORMATION and other
         packages without worrying about address conflicts.

    o    Segment '6002 is now used for PrintMaster's stack.  This
         prevents conflicts with user segments.


                     A D D   P R I N T   J O B

*** o    The keywords -NO_HEADER and -NH (abbrev) have been deleted
***      from the master keyword file and are no longer recognized by
***      the level 2 driver.  Use the -NO_BANNER or -NB (abbrev)
***      keywords instead.  For compatibility, sites using -NO_HEADER
***      and -NH can add these to their master keyword file as
***      abbreviations for -NO_BANNER.

    o    An abbrev, -PR, has been added for the -PRIORITY keyword.

    o    APJ would sometimes blow up with a Job not queued error, and
         print a lot of garbage on the screen.


                    D E V I C E   C O M M A N D

    o    The relative positioning command -POSITION -n has been fixed,
         although -POSITION +n is still broke.  Primos assumes the +
         is a wildcard character.  This will be corrected with 19.4
         EPF's.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    If a device is started and is given a redundant -START command
         with DC, the device was hanging.  This has been corrected.

    o    If an empty file is spooled, an empty file message is printed
         on the banner page.  A banner page is always printed for empty
         files, even if -NO_BANNER was used, to avoid "missing" jobs.

    o    Support has been added for the Versatec/Gould
         printer/plotter.  The device driver name is L3$VG.  The
         Primos device name is PLOT.  Only print mode is supported in
         this release.  A general plot interface for PrintMaster will
         be incorporated in a later release.

    o    A new procedure L2$PRINT_BANNER is responsible for print the
         banner on line-oriented devices.  The source is included on
         the release tape in the directory L2 for customers that want
         to modify the banner.

    o    A new keyword -BANNER_FORMAT allows some customization of the
         banner.  It can be used on either a device or a job, with the
         job overriding the device.  It accepts up to 5 values:

              NO_BANNER      - don't print any banner
              NO_STARS       - don't print stars on the banner
              NO_FILENAME    - don't print the filename in large
                               letters
              NO_USERID      - don't print the user-id in large
                               letters
              NO_COPIES      - don't print number of copies in large
                               letters

         Any other values are ignored.

    o    The keyword -BANNER can now be put on a device to allow a
         message to be included on all jobs printed by the device,
         similiar to the MESSAGE option in the Prime spooler.  Any
         values beginning with an exclamation point are printed in
         large block letters.  If the keyword is also included on a
         job, the job message is printed after the device message.

    o    The stars that are printed on the banner page have been moved
         to the left edge of the page.  Some sites complained that
         printing them on the right side was very slow on letter
         quality printers.

    o    If a device is paused while printing a job and the job is
         deleted from the queue with DPJ, the device was continuing
         from the pause.  This has been corrected so that when the
         -CONTINUE command is given, the job is dropped rather than
         immediately after the DPJ.
