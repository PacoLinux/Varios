The following changes have been made in version 5.4:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


**  There is an update file for version 5.4 (PRINTMASTER>UPD>UPD5.4).
**  Sites upgrading to 5.4 should run this after INSTALL_PRINTMASTER
**  to install new keywords.

    o    When AMLC devices are created, the line is assigned with
         half-duplex and no linefeed echo.  For devices such as
         PostScript printers that send data TO the computer, the
         computer should not echo the data back to the device.

    o    The default response to the question about whether XON/XOFF
         should be used is now YES.

    o    The installation and removal programs have been made more
         robust to accomodate changes Prime made to the spooler
         at revision 21, specifically, loading it as an EPF and
         adding a new shared library, SP$LIB.

    o    PrintMaster was sometimes adding an extra page eject after
         the banner page or deleting part of the first print line if
         it contained data preceeding a form feed character.

    o    Four new keywords have been added to facilite initializing
         special devices.  They are:

            -DEVICE_INIT_FILE, DEVICE_TERMINATE_FILE,
            -JOB_INIT_FILE, JOB_TERMINATE_FILE

         These keywords are followed by one or more pathnames indicating
         files to send to the printer during device and/or job
         initialization and termination.  The keywords can be added to
         device keyword files, form files, or specified when a job is
         queued (however, -DEVICE_xxx_FILE keywords will have no
         effect except in device keyword files).  The sequence of
         commands sent to the printer is:

            1. -DEVICE_INIT_FILE    \  These are sent during device
            2. -DEVICE_INIT_STRING  /  startup from device keyword list

            3. -JOB_INIT_FILE   (from device keyword list)
            4. -JOB_INIT_STRING (from device keyword list)
            5. -JOB_INIT_FILE   (from job keyword list)
            6. -JOB_INIT_STRING (from job keyword list)

            7. -JOB_TERMINATE_FILE   (from job keyword list)
            8. -JOB_TERMINATE_STRING (from job keyword list)
            9. -JOB_TERMINATE_FILE   (from device keyword list)
           10. -JOB_TERMINATE_STRING (from device keyword list)

           11. -DEVICE_TERMINATE_FILE   \  These are sent during device
           12. -DEVICE_TERMINATE_STRING /  shutdown from device keyword list

         Data read from the file is sent to the printer with a
         trailing carriage return and linefeed just like a normal
         text file.  However, if a line ends with a backslash, the
         carriage return and linefeed are not sent.   If a line begins
         with ^001^005 or ^201^005, all data following the line is
         sent in "raw" or binary mode with no translation or added
         characters in 140-character chunks (this is a limit of
         the parallel printer driver in Primos, T$LPMC).

    o    The problem with PostScript printers not going back to the
         idle state has been fixed.  It was due to the AMLC line being
         configured as full-duplex.
