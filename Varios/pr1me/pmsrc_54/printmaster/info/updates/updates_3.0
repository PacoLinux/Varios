The following changes have been made in version 3.0:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

    o    Only 128 users were supported, causing errors on systems
         running 19.3 with more than 128 users configured.  256
         users are now supported.

    o    The binary files are now issued with each release to allow
         customers to rebuild the system.  The necessary files are
         in PRINTMASTER>REBUILD.

    o    There may be some performance improvement at this release
         since the 19.3 SPL compiler was used to rebuild it.

    o    SYS$INIT was calling R$CVT, which was removed from Primos at
         rev 19.3, causing a linkage fault to be raised on systems
         with networks configured.  NPXPRC is now called instead.
