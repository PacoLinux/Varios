The following changes have been made in version 3.5:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

***      Don't forget to run the UPD programs for all revisions prior
***      to your current rev.  These are located in the ufd PRINTMASTER>UPD.
***      See Loading Tape Info for more information.

    o    PrintMaster now requires the use of only three shared
         segments (by default, 2301 through 2303).

    o    This version uses segment 6006/176000 and segment 6007 for
         per-user data structures.  Management of the Primos dynamic
         segments was not possible at all revs of 19.  The segments used
         for the heap can be modified in INIT_PRINTMASTER.CPL

    o    Support of password directories has been added with the
         restriction that -DL (delete after printing) and -^COPYFILE
         will NOT work correctly on a file in a passworded path unless
         priority ACL's are used on the partition.


                     A D D   P R I N T   J O B

*** o    The global variable used by APJ has been changed from
***      .APJ_USER_DEFAULTS to .APJ_DEFAULTS.


                C R E A T E   P R I N T   Q U E U E

    o    If an invalid partition was given on the command line, CPQ
         looped forever printing error messages.

    o    The -QUEUE option has been removed.  To create a queue on a
         specific partition, use   CPQ PARTITION_NAME   rather than
         CPQ -QUEUE PARTITION_NAME.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    The driver keyword -ACCOUNTING_PROC has been replace by
         -ACCOUNTING.  When used on a device, this keyword specifies
         the accounting procedure the device should call.  When used
         on a job, it enables accounting.  This allows accounting by
         user-id or project-id rather than by device.

    o    New devices will return a severity code rather than issuing
         the LOGOUT command when they stop (this will cause phantoms
         to logout however).  This allows other CPL programs to run
         a device as a subroutine.  Existing devices CPL programs
         can be changed manually by replacing the LOGOUT command at
         the bottom of the file by:   &return %severity$%


                 E D I T   K E Y W O R D   F I L E

    o    EKF no longer expands a keyword with the :a flag specified.
         Previously, an attempt to change an abbreviation in a copy
         of a master keyword file would expand the abbrev from the
         actual master keyword file.


                    K E Y W O R D   S Y S T E M

    o    The abbreviations -NB (-NO_BANNER) and -PR (-PRIORITY) were
         deleted by accident at rev 3.4, and have been added at 3.5

    o    -FM is now an abbreviation for -FORM

    o    Previously, the ACL on a keyword file was used to determine
         protection of the keywords it contained.  If a user had
         "P" access to the file, the keywords were NOT protected.  This
         caused some confusion if the keyword file was default protected.
         Now, a default protected keyword file's keywords are NOT
         protected.  To protect keywords for certain users, a specific
         or category ACL must be put on the keyword file.

         This fixes the problem of overwriting library keywords when
         -USING is used.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    The scheduler has been changed so that priority zero jobs
         always print first in, first out.  Previously, a job with
         multiple copies could be interrupted by a smaller priority
         zero job.  An exception to this occurs if a priority zero
         job is changed with CPJ.  This will cause it to be re-queued
         to the end of the priority zero queue.

    o    Faster devices (higher -DEVICE_SPEED keyword values) are now
         scheduled before slower devices, all other criteria being
         equal.

    o    Previously, the monitor checked to make sure each job could
         be opened for reading before scheduling.  Now, only jobs
         that were opened in the print queue with -OPEN are checked.
         A new keyword -OPENED will be placed on the job in this case.
         This may improve performance.


                 S P O O L   R E P L A C E M E N T

    o    Embedded blanks in treenames are now edited out.  This is an
         obsolete feature of TSRC$$ and TA$.  Blanks should not be
         included on any new programs, as Primos does not consider
         these to be valid treenames.

    o    SPOOL$ didn't work if the key was 1 (copy the file) and
         the caller was not written in either SPL or PL/I.

    o    SPOOL$ didn't work if the key was 1, a file name was given
         and you were not attached to your home directory.  This caused
         a file not found error.


                        U S E R   H O O K S

    o    One of the examples has been changed in the procedure
         HOOK$EDIT_JOB_BEFORE_QUEUED; it was incorrect.


                      X E R O X   D R I V E R

    o    A form feed has been added to terminate the loading of the
         constant page with -MERGE.
