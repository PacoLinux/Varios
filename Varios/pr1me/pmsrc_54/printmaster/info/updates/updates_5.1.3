The following changes have been made in version 5.1.3:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)

                      S P O O L $,  S P O O L

    o    If the -AT keyword is used with no value, it is not added to
         the job's keyword list (the default -AT will be used if it
         is in SYSTEM_DEFAULTS).  Previously, -AT with no value
         allowed the job to print on any printer.  This is a feature
         of APJ, but should not have been in SPOOL$ and SPOOL.
