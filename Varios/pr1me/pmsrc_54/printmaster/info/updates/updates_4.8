The following changes have been made in version 4.8:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                     A D D   P R I N T   J O B

    o    The internal system keyword -SYSTEM has been changed to
         -USER_SYSTEM for clarity.  Keywords -JOB_SYSTEM and
         -QUEUE_SYSTEM have also been added; these are only added
         to jobs if they have non-null values (previously, -SYSTEM
         was always added, even though it didn't make sense for non-
         networked environments).

             -USER_SYSTEM      the system the user was logged into
                               when the job was queued

             -JOB_SYSTEM       the system the print job came from

             -QUEUE_SYSTEM     the system the queue containing the
                               job resides on

    o    The internal keyword -PATHNAME is not added to jobs queued
         with the -OPEN option.  Previously, it was added with the
         value "File opened in Print Queue".


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    When a device changed from ready to idle, it was sending
         a redundant status update.  This didn't cause errors.

    o    If a drastic error occurs while printing a job, such as
         a pointer mismatch, disk shutdown, etc., devices were
         logging out rather than handling the error & continuing
         with the next job.  This has been changed so that the
         job is suspended.  Note that suspending the job will
         cause it to be rescheduled.  In a later release, the job
         may be held rather than suspended, to prevent the error
         from recurring.

    o    If a device was not started by the monitor and timed-out,
         its COMO file was not being closed.  Also, it was telling
         the monitor it timed-out, when it should have said it was
         shutting down, because the monitor could not have restarted
         it.  This relates mainly to the TTY driver.

    o    The Versatec driver was not working.  When it was started,
         it would logout with a message like "Attempted output to
         an unknown device".


                  I N I T   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    INIT_PRINTMASTER was looking in PRINTMASTER*>PROGRAMS for
         the SYSTEM_LIST file, but should have been looking in
         PRINTMASTER*.  This caused networks to always be disabled.

    o    INIT_PRINTMASTER removes EPF programs used during
         initialization from the console's address space, to prevent
         file in use errors on subsequent installs.

    o    If INIT_PRINTMASTER was run without the -FULL option on a
         19.4 system, all programs would bomb with ACCESS VIOLATION
         and ILLEGAL SEGNO faults.  This was introduced at rev 4.7
         as a result of removing error text from the shared segment.


               I N S T A L L   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    PrintMaster can now be installed on systems with password
         protected CMDNC0.  ALL access is required during the install,
         but programs are protected with read permission for
         non-owners, read/write/delete permission for owners.

    o    If a system configuration was copied from a remote machine
         during installation, devices created on the TO machine would
         not print jobs.  The level 2 keyword file was not being
         copied, causing some device keywords to be missing.

    o    If a system configuration is copied from a remote machine
         during installation, a question is now asked to determine
         which system is remote.  This allows us to attach to the
         remote machine before the copy, to prevent creating new
         slaves for every COPY command, which would sometimes cause
         No NPX slaves available on systems with only a few slaves
         configured.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    Some efficiency improvements have been made to the network
         code in the monitor.

    o    If a remote disk with a print queue was shutdown, jobs
         sometimes became "stuck" and would not print.

    o    Monitors in a network environment sometimes logged out with
         an error like "Missing critical keywords".

    o    A check has been put in the monitor to help detect other
         users using the monitor's semaphore.  If this occurs, the
         monitor will logout with an error message indicating this.


               R E B U I L D   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    By default, REBUILD_PRINTMASTER will NOT install the new
         version of PrintMaster in CMDNC0 and PRINTMASTER*.  The
         option -NO_INSTALL has been replaced with -INSTALL.  If
         -INSTALL is not used, the new version is only copied to
         PRINTMASTER; INSTALL_PRINTMASTER can be used to install
         the new version.  If -INSTALL is used, the version is
         copied to PRINTMASTER then CMDNC0 and PRINTMASTER*.
