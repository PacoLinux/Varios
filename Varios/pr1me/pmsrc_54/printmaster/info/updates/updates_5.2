The following changes have been made in version 5.2:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


** NOTE: This is the official release of 5.2, and supercedes all
**       previous releases (5.2a, 5.2b)

    o    If an operator is deleting another user's job, DPJ asks for
         verification.  Since the print job is left open until the
         operator answers the question, LPQ cannot list the queue
         (a file in use error occurs).  DPJ has been changed to close
         the print job before asking the question, then re-open the
         job.  A new error may occur if the original job is printed
         and a new one submitted with the same job number AFTER the
         verification question is asked.  This error is "Job xx has
         changed since you began deleting it.".  In this case, the
         job you wanted to delete is no longer in the queue.

    o    The device form type is printed by the DC -STATUS command.

    o    The "off-line" message is no longer printed if the device
         is an AMLC device and the CHECK_CARRIER keyword is not
         present in the device keyword list.

    o    Transparent mode is supported as on the Prime spooler.  This
         is activated by ^001^005 on a line by itself in the print file.
         If nothing follows this control sequence, the rest of the file
         is printed in transparent mode.  If a numeric character string
         follows, it indicates the number of 16-bit words to be printed
         in transparent mode, for example, ^001^0051024 would cause 1024
         words (2048 bytes) to be printed in binary mode.

         No translation is performed in transparent mode, and the -PARITY
         keyword is ignored.

    o    A preliminary PostScript driver is included in this version.  The
         default font is 10-point Courier.  This can be changed by using
         the -DEVICE_INIT_STRING and -JOB_INIT_STRING keywords to send the
         appropriate PostScript commands to the device.  The name of the
         driver is L3$POSTSCRIPT; any interface (PRx, AMLC, etc.) can be
         used with the driver.

    o    The HP Laserjet driver would halt if a bad margin command was
         given, for instance 8.8.5 instead of 8.5

    o    Lines were being truncated at the form feed in paged mode.  This
         was changed so that lines are not truncated to match changes in
         the Prime spooler.

    o    A blank page was sometimes printed after the spooler banner on
         reports from Prime INFORMATION.


                    K E Y W O R D   S Y S T E M

    o    The -TRUNCATE option was accidentally deleted from the master
         keyword file.
