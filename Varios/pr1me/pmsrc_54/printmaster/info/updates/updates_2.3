The following changes have been made in version 2.3:

o   Some timed-out devices may not have started automatically if the
    monitor was shutdown then started up.

o   Keyword flags were being lost when the -LOAD device command was
    given (for example, when the form type was changed)

o   The job keyword -COPIES can now be changed with CPJ.  The number of
    copies can be increased or decreased, even if the job is currently
    printing.  If the new number of copies is less than the number
    already printed, the job is NOT deleted from the queue, and the
    number of copies left to print will be zero; the job should have
    been deleted with DPJ in this case.

o   The job keyword -COPIES is no longer protected

o   A check was included to make sure the number of copies (-COPIES
    keyword) is greater than zero.

o   Modified dates are not copied when CMDNC0 and HELP* files are
    installed with INSTALL_PRINTMASTER; the DTM stamp on these files
    will now be the date of installation.

o   SET_DEVICE_DEFAULTS was change to always enable auto restart if device
    time-out (-TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN) is enabled.

o   The default time before device shutdown was changed from 10 to 15 minutes

o   Form feeds were not working correctly on parallel Printronix printers
    with an EVFU

o   the -AUTO_RESTART keyword must be present on all devices with
    -TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN, unless the device is NOT started by the
    monitor (e.g., the TTY device)
