The following changes have been made in version 4.4:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

    o    Under 19.4, PrintMaster always thought it was running under
         DBG, causing on-unit handling to be disabled.


                S P O O L $   R E P L A C E M E N T

    o    Under 19.4, the SPOOL$ library was not being installed
         in the correct slot.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    In an effort to reduce redundancy in the level 3 drivers and
         to make it easier for users to develop their own drivers, the
         interface between level 2 and level 3 has been completely
         reorganized.  A new procedure called L2$IO has been added.
         Its purpose is to perform a standard output operation (via
         T$AMLC, T$LMPC, TNOUA, T$VG, etc.) for all types of devices.
         The level 3 driver has the option of performing a customized
         output operation or permitting the L2$IO to perform a
         standard operation.

    o    -ALIGN mode was broke on all AMLC devices and gave the error
         message "T$AMLC error 1".

    o    A new optional keyword, -CHECK_CARRIER, has been added for
         AMLC devices.  It causes the carrier to be checked before each
         output operation.  It requires one of these two values:  HIGH
         or LOW.  Output will only be attempted when the line carrier
         agrees with this value.  The device pauses when the carrier
         is in the invalid state.

         Warning:  Even with this check, one output buffer of data will
                   be lost when the device goes offline.

    o    Five additional characters are modified when -UPPERCASE is used
         with a device, to preserve compatibility with Prime's spooler:

                               `  ->  @
                               {  ->  [
                               }  ->  ]
                               |  ->  \
                              del ->  space

    o    The driver was not trapping a conversion error if a command
         was given with a non-numeric parameter when a numeric one was
         expected, e.g., -SUSPEND NOW would cause the device to logout.

    o    A couple of variables were not being initialized to zero.
         Sometimes this would cause DC -STATUS to report a coding
         error, "bad EOJ action".


                           M O N I T O R

    o    The "Entry n deleted" and "No priority ACL" messages in
         the monitor's COMO file have been removed.

    o    When a job was queued with -OPEN, the monitor did not print
         the job according to its actual size once it was closed.  Jobs
         queued with -OPEN always printed after other jobs, even
         though they may have been smaller.

    o    Under networks, the monitor sometimes halted with a coding
         error "Changing device kwl to same?".

    o    Sometimes a fast system would overload a slower one,
         causing data loss.

    o    When a remote system disconnected, pending transmissions
         were not being freed.

    o    The monitor now waits for 3 minutes before reading its
         local queues if networks are configured.  This is to
         decrease overhead during startup.


                 S P O O L   R E P L A C E M E N T

    o    All 19.4 SPOOL command options are now supported.  These
         include:

              -MODIFY, -LIST AT, -DIS, -NOTIFY, -RUSH, -NORUSH,
              -TRUNCATE, -NODEFER
