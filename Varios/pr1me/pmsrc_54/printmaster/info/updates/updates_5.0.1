The following changes have been made in version 5.0.1:

with PrintMaster already installed)

    o    Formerly, the keyword -ACCOUNTING on a job indicated that
         an accounting record should be written when the job prints.
         In rev 5.0.1, -ACCOUNTING can have an optional value which
         is the name of a subroutine to call to set the -ACCT_INFO
         keyword on the job.  The subroutine must be in a static
         mode shared library or an EPF library in the user's search
         list.  The calling sequence for this routine is:

              call acct (user_nr, proj_id, user_id, acct_info);

              dcl acct entry (bin,           /* user # (in) */
                              char(32) var,  /* user id (in) */
                              char(32) var,  /* user's project id (in) */
                              char(128) var);/* value for -ACCT_INFO (out) */

         The name "acct" above is only for illustration.  On entry,
         the argument "acct_info" is the null string.  If the
         subroutine sets this argument to a non-null string, the
         keyword -ACCT_INFO will be added to the job with the string
         in "acct_info" as its value.

         This allows users to put per-user accounting information into
         the standard PrintMaster accounting file.
