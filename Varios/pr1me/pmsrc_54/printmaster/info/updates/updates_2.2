The following changes have been made in version 2.2:

o   Default accounting procedure (PS$ACCOUNTING) now logs an error if
    the accounting file cannot be opened.  (Before, the device would
    bomb.)

o   The monitor now talks to already running (but idle) devices after
    it is restarted.  (The READ/WRITE lock on the device's keyword
    list must be set to UPDT.)

o   CONFIGURE_PRINTMASTER no longer hangs.  (Before, the procedure
    would wait for terminal input, but output was turned off and no
    prompt appeared.)

o   Removed unnecessary options from the &ARGS statement in
    INSTALL_PRINTMASTER.

o   The PS driver now supports channel skips in Prime's NO FORMAT mode.
    (Channel skip commands must appear at the beginning of a line and
    are of the format '030x'b4, where X the channel to skip to.  If
    the second byte is omitted, channel 1 is assumed.)

o   The device now correctly sets the flags on keywords inserted with
    the DC -EDIT command.

o   INIT_PRINTMASTER now shares Prime's SPOOL library before ours.
    (This allows us to make a link to Q$REM before the library
    disappears.  This procedure is called by Prime's SPOOL command to
    remove queue entries.)

o   The Printronix EVFU load now works.

o   The keyword -EVFU has been added to the MASTER keyword file.

o   The default accounting procedure (PS$ACCOUNTING) now writes
    leading zeroes on the record format version number.

o   SYS$INIT now waits until the monitor starts before exiting.  (This
    allows subsequent DC commands in PRIMOS.COMI to work.)

o   Devices may now be started when MAXUSR is zero; the monitor will
    queue the requests and start the devices later.

o   The monitor heap now resides within the normal user address space.
    (Before, segments 4040 through 4057 were used.)

o   SYS$INIT no longer blows up with a remote system partition error
    message when networks are configured.

o   INSTALL_PRINTMASTER no longer blows up with an undefined local
    variable error when run for the first time on a system.
