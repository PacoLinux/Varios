The following changes have been made in version 5.0.7:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


***      It is EXTREMELY important to do the ICE command on the
***      system console before running INIT_PRINTMASTER after
***      installing version 5.0.7.  If the ICE command is not given,
***      PrintMaster will not initialize properly.  This is because
***      the shared segment data structure has changed.

***      Version 5.0.7 should be installed when there are no users
***      on the system.  If an older version of 5.0 is installed,
***      and 5.0.7 is installed while users are on the system, some
***      users will attempt to access the version 5.0.7 shared segment
***      with the old version of PrintMaster.  This will cause various
***      faults, such as ACCESS VIOLATIONS, ILLEGAL SEGMENTS, etc.

    o    A bug was introduced at 5.0.6 that could cause the monitor
         to die with a coding error - Missing critical keywords - if
         networks were configured.

         Information keywords are not stored to save space under
         certain circumstances, but the variable that controls
         this was not always being initialized.
