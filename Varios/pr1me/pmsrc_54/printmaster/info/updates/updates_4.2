    o    A bug in the monitor caused jobs queued with -OPEN and
         without -NO_WAIT to hang after the monitor had been
         operating for more than two days.  Logging out the monitor
         and running INIT_PRINTMASTER would clear the problem for
         another two days.


                 S P O O L   R E P L A C E M E N T

    o    Treewalking and Primos command line modifiers (-AFTER,
         -BEFORE, etc.) now work with the SPOOL replacement command.
