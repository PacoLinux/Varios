The following changes have been made in version 2.5:



                           G E N E R A L

o   On very slow systems, the file and segment locking routines were
    not waiting long enough.  This caused APJ and the device driver
    to logout with a "File in use" or "Can't lock CPS segment" error
    message.  The segment locking routine now uses numbered semaphore
    -2 for process coordination and the file locking procedure waits
    60 seconds instead of 30.

o   Some programs were holding the queue files open longer than
    necessary, causing file in use errors and long delays when adding
    jobs to the queue.  APJ, LPQ, and the device driver were changed
    to close the queue during long operations (such as deleting a
    large job from the queue).

o   All subroutines have been shared, making program startup time
    faster and reducing memory requirements.  Approximately 35 pages
    were removed from every program.  This requires use of another
    shared segment, 2304.  As with the other shared segments, the
    initialization program checks to make sure this segment is not
    already being used by other software.



                    D E V I C E   C O M M A N D

o   If a DC -STATUS command was used while a job that had -COPYFILE and
    -NO_WAIT in its job list was printing, the device would log out.
    The error message in the device's como file was:

       Primos error - End of file - occurred in DS$PROCESS_REQUEST
          (Repositioning print file)

o   If an advance was in progress, the DC -STATUS display said
    "Device is advancing to page n", although it really meant there
    were n pages left until the target page was reached.  The message
    is the same, but the correct page number is now displayed.

o   If a job was queued with -OPEN but without -NO_WAIT, DC -STATUS
    was not printing completion statistics because the device driver
    was not sizing the print file.



                            S P O O L $

o   If SPOOL$ was called with the open key (=2) and the job name was
    supplied in the NAME parameter (rather than the AS parameter),
    the job name was always blank.  This was noticed in RJE jobs which
    formerly had the job name IBM: PRNT.

o   In SPOOL$, if the form type, filename, banner name, or destination
    contained special command line separators such as a comma or blank,
    only the part up to the separator was used, e.g., a form type of
    "8 x 11" came out as "8".



                     A D D   P R I N T   J O B

o   APJ and CPJ only print the informative message that the monitor
    is down if the user is an operator.  This message was confusing
    to normal users.

o   If a file was queued without -COPYFILE and with -NO_WAIT, the
    APJ command used to change the file's read/write lock to UPDT
    to allow devices to read the file while it was open for writing.
    This is not a good idea, since the user may have specifically
    set the lock to some other value, so APJ no longer does this.
    If a file is queued with these two options, it is the user's
    responsibility to make sure the read/write lock is UPDT, or
    the file may not be printed correctly.

o   The method of storing operator notes and banner messages on
    jobs has been changed to use keywords/values rather than
    segment directories in the print queue.  The files BANNER.QUEUE
    and MESSAGE.QUEUE in PRINTMASTER_QUEUE* can be deleted.



                    L I S T   P R I N T   J O B

o   The LPJ command printed all entries in the queue if the -JOB
    option was not used.  This feature was seldom used and has been
    removed.  The -JOB option is now required with LPJ.

o   SPL$LJ was not inserting the QUEUE keyword in the job keyword
    list.



                    K E Y W O R D   S Y S T E M

o   Keyword file names were limited to 29 characters because of the
    three character suffix .KF, preventing user and project defaults
    for id's with more than 29 characters.  In this version, keyword
    file names longer than 29 characters will not have the .KF suffix
    appended.

o   No error message was printed if the master keyword file did not
    exist.  A warning is now printed.



                  L I S T   P R I N T   Q U E U E


o   If a job name ends with " :PRNT", the time it was spooled is
    printed with the job name.  This is a temporary fix until user
    specified keyword selection is implemented.

o   LPQ will try to compute the size of files spooled with the -OPEN
    option.  If the file is still open, a leading + sign is printed on
    the size.  If the file was spooled without -NO_WAIT and is still
    open, the size cannot be computed.

o   The explanation of the values in the Opt column (d, h, and o) has
    been simplified, and only options actually appearing in the LPQ
    output are explained.  The new options s and n have been added for
    suspendable jobs and jobs with notes.



                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

o   All job keywords are printed on the banner page, except:

      BANNER, COPIES, COPIES_LEFT, COPIES_PRINTING, COPIES_COMPLETED,
      COPYFILE, DATE_QUEUED, DATE_MODIFIED, DATE_BACKED_UP,
      JOBID, JOB_NAME, NOTE, PATHNAME, PROJECT, QUEUE, SIZE, SYSTEM
      TRANID, UNIQUE_ID, USER
