The following changes have been made in version 5.0:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)

                           G E N E R A L

***      Current customers should run PRINTMASTER>UPD>UPD5.0 after
***      installing rev 5.0 before starting devices.  Changes are
***      necessary to the device CPL programs for search rules.

    o    PrintMaster has been modified to make use of EPF libraries
         available at 19.4 and above.  It no longer makes use of
         specific shared segments, and rebuilding to prevent a
         segment conflict is not necessary.  Because of this, binary
         files are no longer distributed.  Source for the standard
         level three drivers is included, to be used as a template
         for customers wanting to write custom drivers.  Custom
         drivers can be added without loading or re-compiling any
         standard PrintMaster software.

NOTE:    If installing version 5.0 while users are logged in, the ICE
         or SSR -DFLT ENTRY$ commands will have to be used to activate
         the new search rules.  Otherwise, LINKAGE_FAULT$ conditions
         may be raised.

    o    A bug in the standard L2 driver was causing an extra page
         eject when a -RESTART command was given.


                            S P O O L $

    o    By using search rules, it is now possible to test and
         evaluate the SPOOL$ emulation subroutine with an application
         on a per-user basis, rather than system wide.  This should
         make testing and evaluation easier.
