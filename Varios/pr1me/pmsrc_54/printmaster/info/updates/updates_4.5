The following changes have been made in version 4.5:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                    D E V I C E   C O M M A N D

    o    DC now waits 3 times the time-out limit set in
         INIT_PRINTMASTER.  Previously, it waited 90 seconds.

    o    DC prints "Job queued with -OPEN" rather than "Pathname is
         File Opened in Print Queue" on -STATUS command.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    Devices now respond to idle-qualified commands (e.g., -STOP_IDLE
         as soon as the device goes idle, rather than waiting 30 seconds.

    o    Devices have a new state, ready, which is similar to idle.

    o    -TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN with an value of zero will cause a
         device to shutdown immediately when idle.  In previous
         versions, the device waited 30 seconds.

    o    -TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN will accept floating point values for
         the number of minutes idle before automatic time-out
         (e.g., -TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN 0.5 would be 30 seconds)

    o    The HP LaserJet driver is included in this release.  The
         driver name is L3$LASERJET.  It supports font selection and
         margin setting.  See the manual HP-LASERJET.INFO for complete
         information.

    o    In previous releases, giving a device any command (such as
         -STATUS) would reset its time-out clock.  Now, this clock is
         reset only after a job is printed.  This is a side-effect of
         the new idle handling.

    o    If the device driver program was run from a terminal, it
         could give the error "Device name must be less than 28
         characters", even though the device name was less than
         28 characters.

    o    If -ADVANCE, -BACKUP, or -POSITION was used while the
         device was processing a previous position request, the
         driver halted with a coding error about "suppress_output
         and suppress_accounting both set".  This bug was introduced
         at 4.4


                  I N I T   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    The INIT_PRINTMASTER options such as -TIMELIMIT are now
         specified on the INIT_PRINTMASTER command line rather than
         by changing the CPL variable "options".  This allows the
         SA to change these options in PRIMOS.COMI without having
         to modify INIT_PRINTMASTER with each new release.  The
         options DO NOT have to be given after the first
         INIT_PRINTMASTER.  Defaults for options not given are the
         same as in previous releases.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    A bug introduced at 4.4 caused jobs to hang in the queue
         if -OPEN was used on other jobs.

    o    Job scheduling performance has been increased somewhat.
         This is more likely to be visible as lower monitor overhead
         rather than a shorter delay between job printing.

    o    When the monitor was running in a network environment, a
         small amount of allocated temporary storage was not being
         freed.  This caused the monitor to eventually run out of
         heap storage.

    o    With networks, the monitor MAY delay up to three minutes
         before reading its queues when it is first started.


               R E B U I L D   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    REBUILD_PRINTMASTER always installs the new version of
         PrintMaster in the top-level directory PRINTMASTER, as
         before.  However, if the monitor is running during the
         rebuild, the new version will not be installed in CMDNC0
         and PRINTMASTER*, even if the -NO_INSTALL option was not
         used.

    o    Libraries are now loaded from REBUILD>UTIL rather than
         from the system directory LIB.
