The following changes have been made in version 4.6:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           G E N E R A L

    o    PrintMaster commands now make allowances for a bug in the
         19.1 version of CL$PIX.  The typical symptom of this problem
         was the error message "No print queue on this partition."
         when no print queue was specified.

    o    The static mode version of PrintMaster now loads correctly.
         This version must be used at 19.1 or lower, since the EPF
         mechanism does not work correctly on these revs.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    Floating point expressions have been re-coded to prevent SPL
         (19.3) from generating QUAD-Precision floating point instructions.
         This caused the device to crash on systems running 19.1.

    o    The job accounting feature sometimes caused the device to abort
         with "Unit not open".


                  L I S T   P R I N T   Q U E U E

    o    LPQ is now twice as fast.  Some unnecessary keyword manipulation
         was removed, along with diagnostic tests in a low-level routine.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    Sometimes the monitors got confused if disks were shutdown
         in a network environment.  This could cause jobs to hang in
         the queue.

    o    The monitor now deletes internal device information when a
         device is shutdown.  This will improve performance on systems
         with a large number of inactive devices.

    o    Under some circumstances, the monitor incorrectly handled a
         remote disk shutdown.  This caused some unnecessary overhead,
         but no user-visible problem.
