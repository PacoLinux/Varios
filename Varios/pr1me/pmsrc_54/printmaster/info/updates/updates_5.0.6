The following changes have been made in version 5.0.6:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


***      It is EXTREMELY important to do the ICE command on the
***      system console before running INIT_PRINTMASTER after
***      installing version 5.0.6.  If the ICE command is not given,
***      PrintMaster will not initialize properly.  This is because
***      the shared segment data structure has changed.

***      Version 5.0.6 should be installed when there are no users
***      on the system.  If an older version of 5.0 is installed,
***      and 5.0.6 is installed while users are on the system, some
***      users will attempt to access the version 5.0.6 shared segment
***      with the old version of PrintMaster.  This will cause various
***      faults, such as ACCESS VIOLATIONS, ILLEGAL SEGMENTS, etc.

    o    PrintMaster version mismatches are now detected.  These
         typically occur if a new version is installed while
         users are on the system; the old version of the EPFs
         are already mapped in the user's address space.  Now,
         if a user attempts to run an obsolete EPF, an error
         message is displayed stating that the ICE command
         should be given.

    o    All commands now print the expiration date if the demo
         version of PrintMaster is installed.  This is to help
         avoid surprises.

    o    LIST access is no longer required to a file to queue it.
         However, the date/time modified cannot be read, and will
         not be printed on the banner page.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    A bug in Primos caused plotters using the SOC interface
         (device PLOT) to randomly lose data if operations already
         queued took longer than 5 seconds.  T$VG is checking the
         status vector argument before it is initialized (this is
         an OUTPUT argument from T$VG).  Data was not lost if the
         status vector happened to be zero when T$VG was called.


                  I N I T   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    A new option, -PRIORITY or -PR, has been added to
         INIT_PRINTMASTER.  This option has two values: the first
         is the priority to start the monitor at, the second is
         the device priority.  Priorities can be: -2 for IDLE,
         -1 for DEFAULT, or 0-3 for normal process priorities.
         If not specified, the default monitor priority is 2,
         and the device priority is 1.

    o    INIT_PRINTMASTER will now do a full init whenever a
         new version of PrintMaster has been installed.  This
         should make the -FULL option virtually obsolete.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    If a job was queued with -NO_WAIT, and timed out after
         three minutes, the monitor would usually die within a
         few minutes with some kind of pointer error (NULL_POINTER$,
         ACCESS_VIOLATION$, ILLEGAL_SEGNO$, etc.)


                            S P O O L $

    o    At rev 5.0 and above, SPOOL$ would no longer work if trying
         to spool a file when the current attach point was different
         than the home attach point.  The typical error was a not
         found.  This has been corrected.  Note that the user will
         be attached home after the SPOOL$ call, as in previous
         versions and in the Prime spooler.

    o    Bit 5 in the print option word indicates -NO_EJECT.
