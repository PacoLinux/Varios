The following changes have been made in version 5.0.3:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)



                           G E N E R A L

    o    Manuals now include the PrintMaster version on the title
         page and in the lower right corner of all other pages.


               I N S T A L L   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    INSTALL_PRINTMASTER was asking if rev 20 or above was
         installed.  It should have been rev 20.2 or above.


                  D E L E T E   P R I N T   J O B

    o    The first job that a previously timed-out device printed
         could not be deleted with DPJ.  The queue entry would show
         zero copies left and 1 copy printing, which is correct, but
         the device would never drop the job.  This was caused by a
         bug in the monitor.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    Four keywords were added at rev 5.0.2 to send initialization
         and cleanup strings to devices.  However, the job strings
         (JOB_INIT_STRING, JOB_TERMINATE_STRING) were being printed
         on the banner page, causing the device to reset.  These
         keywords are no longer printed.
