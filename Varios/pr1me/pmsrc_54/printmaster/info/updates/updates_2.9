The following changes have been made in version 2.9:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


                           M O N I T O R

    o    There was a bug in the monitor causing it to crash with an
         ACCESS_VIOLATION$ condition.  This only occurred when more
         than one monitor was started on a network.


               I N S T A L L   P R I N T M A S T E R

    o    Programs in CMDNC0 and PRINTMASTER* are always replaced as
         a unit; it is no longer possible to replace only the commands
         since PrintMaster is shared.
