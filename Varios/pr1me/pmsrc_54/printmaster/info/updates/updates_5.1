The following changes have been made in version 5.1:

(Items marked with stars are especially important for installations
with PrintMaster already installed)


***      Version 5.1 should be installed when there are no users
***      on the system.  If an older version of 5.0 is installed,
***      and 5.1 is installed while users are on the system, some
***      users will attempt to access the version 5.1 shared segment
***      with the old version of PrintMaster.  This will cause various
***      faults, such as ACCESS VIOLATIONS, ILLEGAL SEGMENTS, etc.


                           G E N E R A L

    o    The concept of paper types (not form types) has been removed
         from PrintMaster.  Previously, we had made a distinction between
         these two to allow different form types to share the same paper
         characteristics.  In practice this was seldom used and was
         more confusing than helpful.  The CPD (Create Paper Definition)
         command has been removed, and its functions have been added to
         CFD (Create Form Definition).  Sites with PrintMaster installed
         can continue to use separate paper definitions in the directory
         PRINTMASTER*>LIBRARY>PAPER_LIBRARY, or can use the -EXPAND
         option in EKF to delete these references from their existing
         form definitions, then delete the PAPER_LIBRARY directory.

*** o    At Primos rev 19.4.7 and above, a specific ACL is required
***      on all segment directories in PRINTMASTER_QUEUE*.  CPQ will
***      set ACLs correctly on all new queues.  To correct queues
***      without these specific ACLs, give the command:
***
***           SAC PRINTMASTER_QUEUE*>@@ $REST:DRW -NVFY
***
***      If you receive an error message about ACLs already existing,
***      you don't have the problem and can hit a break.

    o    The system administrator is now always considered an
         operator.


             C R E A T E   D E V I C E   D E F I N I T I O N

    o    CDD will now always put the device name as the value of -AT
         when a device is created.  If any additional destinations are
         entered, they will also be added.


                     D E V I C E   D R I V E R

    o    The DC -LIST command was only printing 4 characters of the
         device's version, not all 6.

    o    A bug in the driver caused errors if more than 256 copies
         were requested.  The first 256 copies printed fine, but
         subsequent copies printed "Resuming from page mark"
         rather than printing the data in the file.

    o    LINES_PER_PAGE defaults to 66, CHARS_PER_LINE defaults to 132.


                          K E Y W O R D S

    o    The keyword -NO_EJECT was added to the master keyword file.


                           M O N I T O R

    o    The Primos procedure NPXPRC has been more or less removed
         at rev 20.2, and this was causing the monitor to crash
         with an UNSUPPORTED_GATE$ condition.  Changes were made
         so that PrintMaster does not call NPXPRC.

    o    A bug in the monitor sometimes caused it to log out with
         a "No data found - enabling interrupts" error.  This
         happened if a device logged out while the monitor was NOT
         idle.  Since the monitor is idle more than 98% of the time,
         the problem was VERY rare (it has only happened three times
         that we know of).

    o    A bug in the monitor sometimes caused it to log out with a
         coding error - "Message to myself?" when networks were
         configured.  The problem would occur if Primenet had multiple
         messages waiting for the monitor.
