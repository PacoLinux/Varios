        1  Manipulating print jobs
+          _______________________




        1.1  Adding a print job
+            __________________


        To add a print job to the queue, use the APJ command.  This is
        followed by the pathname of the file to print, and options to
        describe how the job should be printed.  The simplest form is:

             OK, apj myfile
             [Add Print Job 2.0]
             Job 0 MYFILE added to queue SYS.
             OK,

        Many options can be included after the filename.  The most common are:

            -FORM ABC                     print the file on form type ABC

            -COPIES 25                    print 25 copies of the file
            -CP 25

            -FTN                          column one in the file is a
                                          carriage-control character; this is
                                          not used with NO_FORMAT

            -AT FLOOR3                    prints the file on a specific printe
        r

            -NO_FORMAT                    print file without any pagination or
            -NF                           carriage-control; this is not used
                                          with FTN

        Examples:

           OK, apj jlh>login.cpl -form white
           [Add Print Job 2.0]
           Job 1 LOGIN.CPL added to queue SYS.
           OK,

           OK, apj jlh>login.cpl -form white -hold
           [Add Print Job 2.0]
           Job 2 LOGIN.CPL added to queue SYS.
           OK,

           OK, apj jlh>login.cpl -form white -defer 22:00
           [Add Print Job 2.0]
           Job 3 LOGIN.CPL added to queue SYS.
           OK,

        PrintMaster Operator Command Overview



           OK, apj jlh>login.cpl -form white -no_wait
           [Add Print Job 2.0]
           Job 4 LOGIN.CPL added to queue SYS.
           OK,

        To print another copy of a job queued by another user, type:

           OK, apj pathname -form type -copyfile

        Where PATHNAME is the pathname printed on the banner page and TYPE is
        the form type requested by the user.



        1.2  Listing the print queue
+            _______________________


        Use the LPQ command to monitor print queues.  This command lists all
        jobs in the queue with some of their characteristics.  For example:

 OK, lpq
 [List Print Queue 2.0]

 Jobs in queue SYS:

  User  Job         Job name          Pri  Size  Form  Copy status    At     O
 pt
 ------ --- ------------------------- ---  ---- ------ ----------- --------- -
 --
 JIMMY    0 MYFILE                      5     1 STOCK    1/   /
          1 LOGIN.CPL                   5     1 WHITE    1/   /
          2 LOGIN.CPL                   5     1 WHITE    1/   /
  h
          3 LOGIN.CPL                   5     1 WHITE    1/   /
  d
          4 LOGIN.CPL                   5     1 WHITE    1/   /
  o

 Copy status: copies left/printing/completed.
 Opt (options): Deferred, Hold, print while Open.
 5 jobs in queue.
 OK,

        Under the "Copy status" heading are three fields, describing the
        number of copies left to print (includes copies printing), the number
        of copies printing, and the number of copies completed.


        To list all print queues, including those on remote systems, type:

           OK, lpq -all




        Page    2                                                  Version 5.4

        1.3  Deleting a job
+            ______________


        Use the DPJ command to delete a print job.  The job number printed by
        APJ and LPQ is used to delete the job, for example:

            OK, dpj 0
            [Delete Print Job 2.0]
            Job 0 MYFILE deleted from queue SYS.
            OK,

        Up to 10 jobs can be deleted with one DPJ command by using a list of
        job numbers:

           OK, dpj 0 1 2 3
           [Delete Print Job 2.0]
           Job 0 MYFILE deleted from queue SYS.
           Job 1 LOGIN.CPL deleted from queue SYS.
           Job 2 LOGIN.CPL deleted from queue SYS.
           Job 3 LOGIN.CPL deleted from queue SYS.
           OK,

        If a job has already started printing, it will stop immediately after
        it is deleted with DPJ.

        Be careful when using this command since operators may delete other
        users' jobs.



        1.4  Changing a job
+            ______________


        Use the CPJ command to change certain characteristics of a print job,
        such as the priority or the form type.  Up to 10 jobs can be changed
        with one CPJ command.  The job number printed by APJ and LPQ is used
        to change the job, for example:


 OK, lpq
 [List Print Queue 2.0]

 Jobs in queue SYS:

  User  Job         Job name          Pri  Size  Form  Copy status    At     O

 Opt (options): D = Deferred, O = print while Open.
 5 jobs in queue.
 OK,

        Notice that the priority of job 0 has been changed to 10 and job 2 no
        longer has an "h" in the OPT column.

        Be careful when using this command since operators may change other
        users' jobs.

        2  Manipulating devices
+          ____________________


        PrintMaster devices are controlled with the DC command.  It has the
        basic form:

           DC  device  commands

        A brief explanation of the most commonly used commands is given below
        (for further information see DC - Device Command).



        2.1  Starting a device
+            _________________


        To start a PrintMaster device, use the DC -START command, for
        example:

           OK, dc pr2 -start
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK, stat us

           User                              No  Line Devices
           SYSTEM                             1   asr <PRGDEV> <SYS>
           JIMMY                             68   102 <PRGDEV> <SYS> (3)
           JIMMY                             70   104 <PRGDEV> <SYS> (3)
           JIMMY                             98 phant <PRGDEV> (3)
           BATCH_SERVICE                    101 phant <SYS> (3)
           PR2                              104 phant <SYS> PR2
           PRINTMASTER_MONITOR              105 phant <SYS>
           OK,

        Notice that the user-id of the device phantom is the same as the name
        given in the start command.



        2.2  Checking the status of a device
+            _______________________________


        To check the status of a device, use the DC -STATUS command.  For
        example, when the device is idle:

           OK, dc pr2 -status
           [Device Command 2.0]

           Status of device PR2:
             Driver software is version 2.0
             Device is currently idle.
           OK,

        PrintMaster Operator Command Overview



        When the device is printing:

           OK, dc pr2 -status
           [Device Command 2.0]

           Status of device PR2:
             Driver software is version 2.0
             Device is currently printing job 1 in queue SYS
             Job name is OPR.INFO
             Pathname is <PRGDEV>PROJ>DOC>OPR.INFO
             Page 11 (disk record 8 of 10) is printing.
             Estimate 2 pages left in job (13 total)
             Total elapsed print time is 1 minute
             Estimate 1 minute to finish (at 10 pages/min)
           OK,



        2.3  Stopping a device
+            _________________


        To stop a device immediately, use the DC -STOP command:

           OK, dc pr2 -stop
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,

        To stop a device after the current job, type:

           OK, dc pr2 -stop_eoj
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,

        To stop a device after it completes all jobs in the queue, type:

           OK, dc pr2 -stop_idle
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,

        2.4  Changing the device's form type
+            _______________________________


        To change the form type, use the DC -LOAD command, for example:

           OK, dc pr2 -load white
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,

        To change the form type back to the device's default form type:

           OK, dc pr2 -init
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,



        2.5  List of commands
+            ________________


        This is a list of all commands currently recognized by devices.
        Commands with a star (*) accept either of the optional suffixes _EOJ
        or _IDLE, for example:

        *  -PAUSE                  Pauses the device immediately, after the
                                   current job (-PAUSE_EOJ), or when the
                                   device is idle (-PAUSE_IDLE).

        Some commands accept an optional argument listed in brackets, for
        example:

           -PAUSE [n]              Pauses the device immediately or after N
                                   pages.

        For commands with an optional argument and optional suffixes, only one
        may be used.  For example:

        *  -PAUSE [n]              Pauses the device immediately, after N
                                   pages, after the current job, or when the
                                   device is idle.



           -ABORT [n]              Aborts the current job.
           -ADVANCE n              Advances the print file N pages.
           -ALIGN n                Enters ALIGN mode for N pages.
           -BACKUP n               Backs up the print file N pages.
        *  -CONTINUE               Continues the device if paused.
           -DROP_COPY [n]          Cancels the copy currently printing.
           -DROP_JOB [n]           Cancels all copies of the job currently
                                   printing.
           -EDIT edit_keywords     Edits the device's keyword list.

        3  Form types
+          __________


        PrintMaster form types allow form attributes such as characters per
        line, fonts and margins to be specified with the -FORM option.


        3.1  Creating form types
+            ___________________


        The command used to create form types is CFD.  It will ask you for the
        name of the form, its synonyms, characters per line, and lines per
        page.

        A form name must be a valid filename and less than 30 characters.  If
        users have form types which are not valid filenames, they should be
        made synonyms.  For example:

           -FORM STOCK ' '
           -FORM NARROW_STOCK '8 X 11'
           -FORM FOUR_PART_STOCK 4PRT

        This is similar to the PROP environment options PAPER and FORM.

        It is important that the number of lines per page is correct, or the
        job accounting data will be wrong.



        3.2  Listing form types
+            __________________


        To list the form type STOCK, type:

           OK, ekf stock -lib -list
           [Edit Keyword File 2.0]
              -FORM STOCK
              ' '
