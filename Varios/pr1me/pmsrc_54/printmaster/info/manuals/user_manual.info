        1  Introduction
+          ____________


        This document is a user reference manual for PrintMaster, a set of
        programs designed to replace the Prime SPOOL system.  It describes
        all user commands in detail.  Some familiarity with Prime's SPOOL
        system is assumed.

        All PrintMaster commands accept the option -HELP, which will give a
        brief description of how to use the command.  Additional help is
        available via Prime's HELP command.

        2  APJ - Add Print Job
+          ___________________

        This command is used to queue files for printing.  It has the
        following basic forms:

           (1)  APJ  pathname  options
           (2)  APJ  -OPEN unit  options
           (3)  APJ  -HELP

        In the first form, PATHNAME will be queued for printing.  In the
        second form, a job will be added to the queue and a file will be
        opened for writing on UNIT; if UNIT is not given, unit 2 will be
        used.

        This is equivalent to the following SPOOL commands:

           (1)  SPOOL  pathname  options
           (2)  SPOOL  -OPEN  options
                SPOOL  -OPEN  -TUNIT unit

        The job keyword list is created in 6 steps:

           (1)  Default keywords are inserted
           (2)  JOB_KEYWORDS are taken from the value of the global variable
                 ".APJ_DEFAULTS" if it exists; keywords are in command line
                 format.
           (3)  Finally, OPTIONS from the command line are inserted.


        2.1  Optional Job Keywords
+            _____________________


           -ACCT_INFO  Causes a user-defined message to be written with the
                       accounting record for this job.  It has the form:

                          -ACCT_INFO message

           -ACCOUNTING Causes paper usage accounting to be enabled for the job
        .

           -AT         Forces the job to be printed on a device at one of the
                       specified destinations.  It has the form:

                          -AT dest1 dest2 ...

                       Each DEST must be a valid destination (see your System
                       Administrator for these).

                       This is similar to Prime's -AT option.

           -BANNER     Prints a message on the banner page.  It has two forms
                       on the command line:



        Page    2                                                  Version 5.4

                                                           APJ - Add Print Job




                          (1)  -BANNER msg1 ... msg10
                          (2)  -BANNER

                       In form one, up to 10 single quoted message lines may
                       be given.

                       In form two, APJ will prompt you with ">" and ask for
                       the message.  You may enter up to 10 lines, entering a
                       blank line to terminate the message.

                       Message lines can be up to 80 characters long.

           -CHARS_PER_LINE
                       Sets the number of characters to be printed per line.
                       Lines longer than this will be wrapped around, or
                       truncated depending on whether -WRAP and -TRUNCATE are
                       used.  It has the form:

                          -CHARS_PER_LINE n

                       N must be greater than zero and less than 500.
                       This keyword overrides the device's value.

           -COPIES     Sets the number of copies to print.  It has the form:
           (abbr -CP)
                          -COPIES n

                       N must be greater than zero.  If this keyword is
                       omitted, one copy will be printed.

           -COPYFILE   Copies the print file to the queue.

                       If this keyword is omitted, a copy of the file is not
                       made in the print queue, and devices will print the job
                       from the original file.

                       This keyword is supplied automatically when the option
                       -OPEN is used.

           -DEADLINE   Sets the date/time the user wants the job to START
                       printing.  It has two forms:

                          (1)  -DEADLINE NOW
                          (2)  -DEADLINE date

                       In the first form, the starting deadline will be set
                       to the current date/time.  In the second form, the
                       deadline will be set to the date/time given.  DATE
                       must not have already elapsed and must be one of the
                       standard Primos forms:




        Version 5.4                                                  Page    3

        PrintMaster User Reference Manual



                          (1)  YY-MM-DD.HH:MM:SS.DOW
                          (2)  MM/DD/YY.HH:MM:SS.DOW
                          (3)  DD MM YY HH:MM:SS DAY_OF_WEEK

                       Missing fields are automatically supplied with the
                       current time/date information.  Format 3 must be quoted
                       since it contains blanks.

                       When the deadline expires, the job will be printed on
                       the next available device (after, of course, any jobs
                       whose deadline expired earlier).

                       The job may print sooner than the deadline.

                       This keyword may not be used when the keyword -PRIORITY
                       has a value of zero.

           -DEFER      Defers the job until the specified date.  It has the
                       form:

                          -DEFER date

                       DATE must be one of the standard Primos date forms (see
                       option -DEADLINE) and must not have already elapsed.

                       This is similar to Prime's -DEFER option.

           -DEVICE_NAME
                       Forces the job to be printed on one of the devices
                       specified.  It has the form:

                          -DEVICE_NAME name1 name2 ...

                       Each NAME must be a valid device name (see your System
                       Administrator for these).

           -DL         Deletes the original file after successfully printing
                       the last copy.  This requires D access to the parent
                       directory.  The file will not be deleted if it is
                       delete protected, or if -DL is removed from the job
                       while it is printing.

           -FORM       Forces the job to be printed on one of the form types
           (abbr -FM)  listed.  It has the form:

                          -FORM type1 type2 ...

                       Each TYPE must be a system defined FORM type (see your
                       System Administrator for these).

                       This is similar to Prime's -FORM option.

                                                           APJ - Add Print Job



           -FTN        Prints the job in FTN format, with carriage control in
                       column 1.  Carriage control characters recognized are:

                                 +       skip zero lines
                               space     skip 1 line
                                 0       skip 2 lines
                                 -       skip 3 lines
                                 1       skip to channel 1 (page eject)
                                 2       skip to channel 2 (etc. to channel 9)
                                 A       skip to channel 10
                                 B       skip to channel 11
                                 C       skip to channel 12
                               other     skip 1 line

           -HOLD       Holds the job until released by either the user or
                       operator.

           -JOB_NAME   Sets the name of the job.  It has the form:
           (abbr -AS)
                          -JOB_NAME print_name

                       If this keyword is omitted, PRINT_NAME will be set to
                       the filename portion of the job's pathname.  If the
                       option -OPEN is used, PRINT_NAME will be set to blanks.

                       This is similar to Prime's -ALIAS (or -AS) option.

           -LINES_PER_PAGE
                       Sets the number of print lines on the page.  It has the
                       form:

                          -LINES_PER_PAGE n

                       N must be greater than zero.
                       This keyword overrides the device's value.

           -LINE_NUMBERS
           (abbr -LN)  Prints line numbers on the left edge of the page.

                       Line numbers will only be printed in PAGED mode and
                       NO_FORMAT mode.

                       This is similar to Prime's -LNUM option.

           -NO_BANNER  Suppresses job information on the banner page.
           (abbr -NB)
                       The user banner message (see option -BANNER) will still
                       be printed.  If no user message is given, no banner
                       page will be printed.

                       This is similar to Prime's -NOHDR option, except a
                       blank page is not printed.



        Version 5.4                                                  Page    5

        PrintMaster User Reference Manual




           -NO_FORMAT  Prints the job in Prime's no format mode.
           (abbr -NF)
                       This is similar to Prime's -NOFMT option.

           -NO_WAIT    Allows the job to begin printing while it is still
                       being written.

                       If the option -COPYFILE is not used, the file's read/
                       write lock must be UPDT or NONE to allow the device
                       to open the file for reading while it is open
                       for writing.  If this is NOT done, the job will be
                       printed when it is closed.

                       This is especially useful for RJE jobs, since the job
                       can begin printing while still being transmitted.

           -NOTE       Puts a note to the operator on the job.  It has the
                       same form and restrictions as -BANNER.

           -NOTIFY     Notifies the user when the job is completed.  It has
                       two forms:

                          (1)  -NOTIFY
                          (2)  -NOTIFY NOW

                       The device will send the user a message via the Primos
                       MESSAGE facility after the last copy has been printed.
                       If form one is used, the message will be deferred.  If
                       form two is used, the message will be sent immediately
                       if possible, and deferred otherwise.

           -PAGE_HEADER
           (abbr -PH)  Sets the page header line in PAGED mode.  It has the
                       form:

                          -PAGE_HEADER message

                       MESSAGE must be quoted if it contains blanks.  If
                       MESSAGE is blank, no page header will be printed.

                       If this keyword is omitted, the default page header
                       "<pathname>, -- Last modified <date>" will be printed.

           -PARALLEL   Allows multiple copies to be printed simultaneously
                       on different printers.

           -PAUSE_EJECT
                       Forces the job to be printed on a device that has sheet
                       feed capability.  It has two forms:

                          (1)  -PAUSE_EJECT



        Page    6                                                  Version 5.4

                                                           APJ - Add Print Job



                          (2)  -PAUSE_EJECT RING

                       Sheet feeding is only supported on TTY devices.  Both
                       forms will cause the device to pause after each page
                       until a character is typed.  In the second form, in
                       addition to pausing, the bell will ring.

           -PRIORITY   Sets the job's priority.  It has the form:
           (abbr -PR)
                          -PRIORITY n

                       N must be greater than or equal to zero and less than
                       1000.  If N is zero, the job will be scheduled in
                       first-in-first-out fashion with all other priority zero
                       jobs.  If N is not zero, the job with the largest
                       priority will be printed first.  The option -DEADLINE
                       may not be used with priority zero jobs.

                       This keyword is required for all jobs.

           -QUEUE      Specifies the queue to put the job in.  It has the
                       form:

                          -QUEUE queue_partition

                       If this keyword is omitted, the job will be added to
                       the first queue found.

                       If the print queue is moved to another partition, the
                       value for this keyword will automatically be adjusted.

                       This keyword is restricted to the command line and may
                       not appear in a keyword file.

           -QUIET      Supresses the printing of any messages in large
                       (banner) letters during device positioning.

                       This is useful for forms with sequence numbers, e.g.
                       payroll checks.

           -SET_VAR    Sets a global variable to the JOB_ID of the job added.
           (or -SV)    It has the form:

                          -SET_VAR global_variable

                       For example:

                          OK, APJ MY_FILE -SV .MY_JOB_ID
                          [Add Print Job 2.0]
                          Job 0 MY_FILE added to queue SYS.
                          OK, TYPE My job is number %.my_job_id%.
                          My job is number 0.
                          OK,

                       This keyword is restricted to the command line and may
                       not appear in a keyword file.

           -SUSPENDABLE
                       Indicates that copies of the job may be suspended.
                       If a copy is suspended by the operator or interrupted
                       by a hardware failure, it will resume printing at the
                       top of the page that was printing when the copy was
                       suspended.  This is especially useful when working
                       with large print files.  For example:

                          (1)  Operators may suspend large jobs to allow
                               smaller or more important jobs to print.
                          (2)  Jobs may be resumed after problems like system
                               halts and network/RJE errors.

                       If this keyword is omitted, the job is not suspendable
                       and will be RESTARTED after a network/RJE error.  This
                       is how Prime's spooler works.

           -TRUNCATE   Causes the device to truncate any line which is longer
                       than the paper width (value of -CHARS_PER_LINE).

           -UPPERCASE  Forces the job to be printed on a device that prints in
                       uppercase only.

           -WRAP       Wraps lines whose length exceeds the line length given
                       by the -CHARS_PER_LINE keyword, or the device's default
                       line length if this keyword is omitted.

                       Lines are ALWAYS truncated after 500 characters.

        2.2  Job Keywords Always Inserted by APJ
+            ___________________________________

        As mentioned above, the job keyword list is created in 5 steps.  In
        step 1, internal keywords are inserted by the APJ command.  The
        following is a list of those keywords.


           -COPIES_COMPLETED
                       This is the number of copies that have been completed.
                       Set to zero initially, it is updated when a device
                       completes a copy.  It has the form:

                          -COPIES_COMPLETED n

                       N is greater than or equal to zero.

           -COPIES_LEFT
                       This is the number of copies that are left to print.
                       Set to the number of copies requested initially, it is
                       updated when a device completes a copy.  It has the
                       form:

                          -COPIES_LEFT n

                       N is greater than zero.

           -COPIES_PRINTING
                       This is the number of copies that are currently
                       printing.  Set to zero initially, it is updated when
                       a device begins a copy.  It has the form:

                          -COPIES_PRINTING n

                       N is greater than or equal to zero.

                       N may be incorrect if a system error occurs while the
                       job is printing (e.g. Primos file system errors).

           -DATE_MODIFIED
                       This is the date/time that the print file was last
                       modified.  It has the form:

                          -DT_MODIFIED date

                       DATE is of the form:

                          DD MON YY HH:MM:SS: DAY_OF_WEEK

           -DATE_QUEUED
                       This is the date/time that the job was queued.
                       It has the same form as -DATE_MODIFIED.

        PrintMaster User Reference Manual



           -JOBID      This is the job's number in the queue.  It has the
                       form:

                          -JOBID n

                       N is greater than or equal to zero.

           -PATHNAME   This is the pathname of the print file.  It has the
                       form:

                          -PATHNAME pathname

                       PATHNAME is a complete Primos pathname.  If the option
                       -OPEN is used, PATHNAME will be set to:

                          File opened in Print Queue

           -PROJECT    This is the Primos project of the user submitting the
                       job.  It has the form:

                          -PROJECT name

           -SIZE       This is the size of the print file rounded to the
                       nearest disk record.  It has the form:

                          -SIZE n

                       If the option -OPEN is used, N is the current size of
                       the print file.  This will be preceeded by a plus sign
                       (+) if the job is still being written.

           -USER_SYSTEM
                       This is the Primos system id of the user submitting the
                       job.  It has the form:

                          -USER_SYSTEM name

           -USER       This is the user id of the user submitting the job.  It
                       has the form:

                          -USER name

        3  CPJ - Change Print Job
+          ______________________

        This command is used to change the keyword list of jobs already
        queued.  It has the following basic forms:

           (1)   CPJ  job_list  queue_option  edit_keywords
           (2)   CPJ  -HELP

        In the first form, JOB_LIST is a list of the id numbers of the jobs to
        change and has the form:

           jobid_1 ... jobid_10

        Job id's must be greater than or equal to zero.  Up to 10 jobs can be
        changed at once.  JOBID_1 is required, but JOBID_2 through JOBID_10
        are optional.

        QUEUE_OPTION gives the partition of the print queue in which jobs are
        to be changed.  This is optional and has the form:

           -QUEUE partition

        If this keyword is omitted, the first print queue that is found will
        be used.

        EDIT_KEYWORDS is a keyword list that is used to EDIT the keyword list
        of all jobs specified (see EDITING KEYWORD LISTS).  New keywords can
        be inserted in a job, and unprotected keywords already in a job can
        be modified.  The LPJ command will be useful to determine which
        keywords are protected (i.e., are not followed by the :p keyword
        flag).  None of these system keywords can be modified or added to
        print jobs:

                       -COPIES_LEFT            -PATHNAME
                       -COPIES_PRINTING        -PROJECT
                       -COPIES_COMPLETED       -QUEUE
                       -COPYFILE               -SIZE
                       -DT_MODIFIED            -SYSTEM
                       -DT_QUEUED              -TRANID
                       -JOBID                  -UNIQUE_ID
                       -NO_WAIT                -USER



        Users may only change their own jobs, that is, ones that have the same
        USER and PROJECT id.

        Except for -DL and -NOTIFY, changing the job keyword list will only
        affect copies which are not currently printing.

        4  DPJ - Delete Print Job
+          ______________________

        This command is used to delete jobs from the print queue.  It has the
        following basic forms:

           (1)  DPJ  job_list  queue_option
           (2)  DPJ  -HELP

        In the first form, JOB_LIST is a list of the id numbers of the jobs to
        delete.  Users or operators may delete up to 10 jobs at once.
        JOB_LIST has the form:

           jobid_1 ... jobid_10

        Job id's must be greater than or equal to zero.  JOBID_1 is required;
        JOBID_2 through JOBID_10 are optional.

        This is equivalent to the SPOOL command:

           SPOOL -CANCEL jobid_1 ... jobid_10

        QUEUE_OPTION gives the partition of the print queue that jobs are to
        be deleted from.  This is optional and has the form:

           -QUEUE partition

        If this keyword is omitted, the first print queue that is found will
        be used.

        Users may only delete their own jobs; that is, ones that have the same
        USER and PROJECT id.  Operators may delete any job.

        When a job is deleted, any copies currently printing will be dropped.

        5  LPJ - List Print Job
+          ____________________

        This command is used to print the keyword list of jobs already queued.
        It has the following basic forms:

           (1)  LPJ  job_id  -LIST pathname  queue_option
           (2)  LPJ  -HELP

        In the first form, the keyword list of the job with the id JOB_ID will
        be listed.  If the option -LIST is used, the keyword list will be
        written to the file PATHNAME, otherwise it will be printed on the
        user's terminal.  The keyword list is printed in TEXT format.  (see
        KEYWORD LISTS - TEXT FORMAT for a description of text format.)

        QUEUE_OPTION specifies the print queue to use.  This is optional and
        has the form:

           -QUEUE partition

        If this keyword is omitted, the first print queue found will be used.

        6  LPQ - List Print Queue
+          ______________________

        This command is used to list, in tabular form, certain keywords of
        certain jobs in a print queue.  It has the following forms:

           (1)  LPQ  queue_option  select_option
           (2)  LPQ  -HELP

        QUEUE_OPTION specifies the queue or queues to be listed.  It is
        optional and has the form:

           -ALL                 List all queues, this is equivalent to the
                                SPOOL command:  SPOOL -LIST *
           -QUEUE partition     List the print queue on the partition given.

        If this option is omitted, the first print queue found is listed, this
        is equivalent to the SPOOL command:  SPOOL -LIST

        SELECT_OPTION specifies which jobs to list.  Only jobs which "match"
        the keyword list given will be listed.  It is optional and has the
        following form:

           -SJ keyword_list

        For example:

           LPQ -SJ -FORM STOCK WHITE -USER MY_USER_ID

        This command will list all jobs on form STOCK or WHITE, submitted by
        the user MY_USER_ID.

        If keywords -USER, -PROJECT, or -SYSTEM are given without a value the
        program will supply default values.

        The values of the following keywords will be listed.  Values too long
        to fit in the field size are truncated.  To see the complete values,
        use LPJ.

           -AT
           -COPIES_LEFT
           -COPIES_PRINTING
           -COPIES_COMPLETED
           -FORM
           -JOB_NAME
           -JOBID
           -USER
           -PRIORITY
           -SIZE                The value of this keyword is the size of the
                                print file in disk records.  If the value is
                                preceeded by a plus sign then the file is stil
        l
                                being written and the file size is the CURRENT

                                unknown.

        The presence of any of the following keywords will cause a code to be
        listed under the heading OPT.

        7  SPOOL replacement command
+          _________________________

        If PrintMaster has been configured to perform all print operations,
        Prime's SPOOL command will be replaced by a CPL program that
        translates SPOOL options into equivalent PrintMaster commands.  This
        allows a site to switch from Prime's spooler to PrintMaster without
        changing most command files and CPL programs or retraining users.  The
        new SPOOL command has the following basic forms:

           (1)  SPOOL  command_options  -PRIME
           (2)  SPOOL  command_options

        In the first form, the command will be passed as is to Prime's SPOOL
        command.  Note that jobs will always be added to the PrintMaster print
        queue, since Prime's SPOOL command calls the shared procedure SPOOL$,
        which has also been replaced.  However, options -LIST and -CANCEL will
        still list and modify Prime's spool queue.

        In the second form, the command will be translated into equivalent
        PrintMaster commands.  If your System Administrator has enabled
        automated retraining, the equivalent PrintMaster commands will be
        listed.  The following options are supported with any discrepancies
        noted:

                   OPTION                      DISCREPANCY
+                  ______                      ___________

           -AS, -ALIAS name
           -A, -AT destination
           -CA, -CAN, -CANCEL n1 ... n10    Only 10 jobs may be specified.
                                            Form "-CANCEL PRTxxx"  or
                                            "-CANCEL xxx" can be used.
           -COP, -COPIES n
           -D, -DE, -DEF, -DEFER time       If time has already elapsed, the
                                            job is NOT queued.  Prime's will
                                            assume next day printing.
           -FO, -FOR, -FORM type
           -F, -FT, -FTN
           -LI, -LIS, -LIST                 Only the following "-LIST" options
