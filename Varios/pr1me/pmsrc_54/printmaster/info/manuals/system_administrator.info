                                                               System Overview



        1  SYSTEM OVERVIEW
+          _______________

        PrintMaster is a new printer management system for Prime computers.
        It runs under standard Primos, revision 19.4 and up, and replaces the
        functionality of the Prime spooler.  It was designed for
        compatibility with the Prime spooler, convenience, and excellent
        performance, even over a network.



        1.1  Compatibility
+            _____________

            o    Can be run concurrently with the Prime spooler

            o    CPL procedures simulate Prime's SPOOL and PROP commands;
                 most existing CPL and command files will work unmodified.

            o    A compatible replacement subroutine allows programs calling
                 SPOOL$ to run without recompiling or reloading.  This
                 includes all Prime software, such as RJE, FTS, FORMS,
                 INFORMATION, and compilers, as well as third-party software
                 such as WordMARC.

            o    Customers are encouraged to write their own drivers for
                 non-standard devices.  Drivers are supplied for DataPrinter,
                 Printronix, AMLC, TTY, Xerox 2700-II, Xerox 3700, Xerox
                 4045, and HP LaserJet  printers.  Average device drivers
                 range from 30 to 150 lines of PL/I.



        1.2  Convenience
+            ___________

            o    Extensive operator printer control, including commands
                 to ADVANCE and BACKUP any number of printed pages, POSITION
                 to a specific page, ALIGN custom forms, SUSPEND job at a page
                 break then resume later where it left off, RESTART, ABORT,
                 DROP_COPY, DROP_JOB and others.

            o    Operators can control printers and queues on remote systems
                 as if they were local.

            o    Form and device characteristics are maintained separately,
                 allowing the same form definitions to be used for all devices
                 with no duplication.

            o    User and operator controlled job deadlines and priorities.

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        1.3  Performance
+            ___________

            o    Low system overhead and fast print job turnaround, especially
                 at installations with networks and/or many printers.  No
                 disk I/O or slaves are used to "scan" print queues; instead,
                 event messages are sent when jobs are queued.

            o    Printer phantoms log out after they are idle for a
                 specified period of time, and will log back in when given a
                 job to print.

            o    Optionally, jobs can begin printing while being created.
                 This is especially useful for RJE print jobs.

            o    Files can be printed directly from user directories (local or
                 remote) without being copied to the print queue, saving time
                 and disk space.  This is also more secure.

            o    Multiple copies of a job can be printed simultaneously on
                 different printers.

            o    Paper accounting procedures log all job and device attributes
                 (total pages printed, user id, project id, form type, etc.)
                 to a Primos file after each job prints.

                                                                  Installation



        2  INSTALLATION
+          ____________

        PrintMaster is installed in two phases.  In phase 1, both PrintMaster
        and the Prime spooler can operate concurrently.  This allows
        evaluation of the software without affecting the operations staff or
        users.  When phase 2 is installed, the Prime spooler is completely
        replaced; emulations are provided for the SPOOL and PROP commands,
        and the SPOOL$ subroutine is replaced by a procedure with the same
        name and calling sequence that queues jobs to PrintMaster queues.
        This allows existing applications programs, third-party software, and
        Prime system software using SPOOL$ (such as compilers, RJE, etc.) to
        be run under PrintMaster without recompiling or reloading, and allows
        most existing command files and CPL programs using the SPOOL command
        to work without modification.  A program is also provided to remove
        PrintMaster or revert to phase 1 after phase 2 has been installed.


        2.1  Installation - Phase 1
+            ______________________

        Load the release tape to create the PRINTMASTER directory according
        to the enclosed instructions.  Login as the system administrator for
        installation, since access to CMDNC0 and an MFD will be required.
        Networks are not configured in Phase 1; a separate section gives
        details on how to configure systems in a network.  Most customers
        will want to try PrintMaster on a single system before installing it
        on other nodes in a network.

        IMPORTANT:  If the PRINTMASTER directory is on a remote system, you
                    must be logged in to the system being installed.


        2.1.1  Decide where to put the system directory
+              ________________________________________

        The system directory, PRINTMASTER*, will require approximately
        250 disk records and will be frequently accessed.  A good
        partition for this would be the one used for CMDNC0, LIB and SYSTEM.


        2.1.2  Decide where to put print queues
+              ________________________________

        The same partition used for SPOOLQ would be a good choice.  The queue
        directory PRINTMASTER_QUEUE* is frequently accessed; the disk space
        required fluctuates widely depending on the number of jobs queued,
        the size of each job, and whether or not jobs are copied to the
        queue.  An empty queue requires 4 disk records.  Each job queued
        requires at least 2 disk records, or 2 plus the file size if the job
        is copied to the queue.  At least one local queue should be created.








        Version 5.4                                                  Page    3

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        2.1.3  Run the installation program
+              ____________________________

        This will install the PrintMaster commands in CMDNC0 and help files
        in HELP*.  It will ask if the Prime spooler should be replaced.
        Usually this is not done during your testing and evaluation of
        PrintMaster, and can be done later.  If the Prime spooler is
        replaced, it is backed up so that it can be re-installed if
        PrintMaster is removed from the system, or Prime and PrintMaster
        concurrent operation is needed.  The installation program will also
        ask for the partition to install the system directory on.  You must
        have ALL access to HELP*, CMDNC0, PRINTMASTER, and the system
        partition MFD for INSTALL to work properly.  (The easiest way to do
        this is to put a priority ACL on the partition(s) containing these
        directories before running INSTALL_PRINTMASTER using the SPAC
        command.)   Print queues may be configured at this time; the program
        will ask for partition names where queues are to be located.  You
        must have ALL access to each partition's MFD.  INSTALL_PRINTMASTER can
        be rerun if necessary, although the dialog will be different.

            OK, a printmaster
            OK, r install_printmaster

        NOTE: If PrintMaster is installed on a non-ACL partition, several
              error messages will be printed from the set_access command.
              These can be ignord.


        2.1.4  Run the initialization program
+              ______________________________

        After the installation program has been run, PrintMaster is ready to
        be initialized.  The initialization program is run from the system
+                        _________________________________________________
        console:
+       _______

            OK, init_printmaster
            [INIT_PRINTMASTER ver 3.5]
            Copyright (C) 1984-1988 Merit Software, Inc.

            Shared segment 2600 allocated.
            Shared databases initialized (on 19 Feb 85 22:06:38 Tuesday).
            PRINTMASTER_MONITOR started (user 103).
            OK,

        If networks are configured, PrintMaster requires dedicated use of a
        Primenet port.  The default network port can be changed in
        INIT_PRINTMASTER.CPL if it conflicts with other software.

        If print jobs are not going to be copied to the queue, the -PACL
        option should be used.  This gives PrintMaster system programs (such
        as devices) access to all files on the system.  The user-id SYSTEM
        should have LU access to all MFDs to allow the initialization program
        to read the current priority ACL on all partitions, and modify them
        to include .PRINTMASTER_SYSTEM:ALL.



        Page    4                                                  Version 5.4

                                                                  Installation




        After INIT_PRINTMASTER has been run, the phantom PRINTMASTER_MONITOR
        will appear in a STATUS USERS command.  Your Primos startup file
        (C_PRMO or PRIMOS.COMI) may be modified to run INIT_PRINTMASTER.
        This will not affect the Prime spooler; it is still used for
        "production" printing during phase 1.

        IMPORTANT NOTE: The priority ACL .PRINTMASTER_SYSTEM:ALL must be
+       ______________
        on all partitions if devices are to print jobs directly from user
        directories (-COPYFILE option not used).  Running INIT_PRINTMASTER
        with the -PACL option will insure the priority ACL's are set
        correctly on all partitions.


        2.2  Installation - Defining Operators
+            _________________________________

        A PrintMaster operator is the system administrator, and any users in
        the Primos ACL group ".PRINTMASTER_OPERATOR".  Users are put in this
        group with Prime's EDIT_PROFILE command.  Any number of users can be
        operators.  Operators have all privileges of normal users, and can
        additionally issue commands to control devices and manipulate other
        users' jobs.


        2.3  Installation - Configuring Optional Features & Defaults
+            _______________________________________________________

        Many features in PrintMaster can be disabled/enabled on a per-site
        basis.  The program to do this is CONFIGURE_PRINTMASTER in the
        PRINTMASTER directory.  The default PrintMaster configuration is
        sufficient for testing and evaluation.  The CONFIGURE program can be
        run from a user terminal after INIT_PRINTMASTER has been run from the
        system console:

            OK, a printmaster
            OK, r configure_printmaster

        The configuration program will go through a question and answer
        session to customize PrintMaster.  Questions such as the standard
        form characteristics (lines per page, characters per line, etc.) will
        be asked.

        2.4  Installation - Creating and Starting Devices
+            ____________________________________________

        After the configuration program has been run, devices need to be
        created.  This is done with the CDD (Create Device Def) command.  It
        will ask for characteristics of the device such as its destination
        (-AT keyword), the ability to print upper and lower case text, and
        the printer type and Primos device name.


        2.5  Installation - Creating Custom Form Definitions
+            _______________________________________________

        One form definition was created above, since every device requires a
        default form type.  Eventually, all custom forms should have form
        definitions created.  This will allow the operator to change form
        types with a single command:

            OK, dc pr0 -load stock
            [Device Command 2.0]
            Commands accepted.
            OK,

        This command would load the form type STOCK on device PR0; characters
        per line, lines per page, lines per inch, and all other form
        characteristics are set.  Until these definitions are created, the
        EDIT command has to be used:

           OK, dc pr0 -edit -form stock -chars_per_line 132 -lines_per_page 66

        These are fully explained in the Operator's Guide.


        2.6  Installation - Configuring Networks
+            ___________________________________

        PrintMaster was designed for fast response in a network environment.
        Jobs will usually begin printing 5 to 10 seconds after they are
        queued.  To achieve this performance, some special configuration
        steps are needed when devices and queues are shared by networked
        systems.  If devices and queues are not shared, this step can be
        omitted.  There are three basic network configurations supported by
        PrintMaster at revision 19.2: rings with no attached nodes (via MDLC,
        ICS), rings with a single attached node, and a point-to-point
        network.  All other configurations must be expressed in some
        combination of these three.  At 19.3 and above, all configurations
        are supported, and the network should be configured as if it were a
        single ring with no attached nodes.










        Page    6                                                  Version 5.4

        2.6.1  The System List
+              _______________

        A single file, called SYSTEM_LIST in the system directory
        PRINTMASTER*, has the network configuration information.  This list
        contains the Primenet system names of all systems sharing printers
        and queues.  Each system will have its own system list, and each
        system list must be identical.  It is created with the CPL program
        CREATE_SYSTEM_LIST.CPL in PRINTMASTER*>PROGRAMS.  There are rules for
        creating the three different network configurations.  Remember, at
        19.3, the network should be configured as if it were a single ring
+                                              ___________________________
        with no attached nodes.  CREATE_SYSTEM_LIST may be re-run if the
+       ______________________
        network configuration created is incorrect.


        2.6.2  Configuring a Ring
+              __________________

        Rings networks are easy to configure.  All nodes sharing devices and
        queues are in the system list.  Usually this will be all nodes in the
        network.  The systems should be ordered by their typical response
        time, first the faster ones, then slower ones.  It is possible to
        create multiple networks out of the single ring.  For example, if A,
        B, C, D, and E are in a ring network, and A, B, and C are to share
        devices and queues, while D and E are to share their devices and
        queues, the system lists on A, B, and C would have only these three
        listed.  The system lists on D and E would just contain these two.


        2.6.3  Configuring a Ring With a Single Attached Node
+              ______________________________________________

        When an extra node is attached to the ring via a synchronous link,
        the system list is configured as if all systems were in the ring,
        with the exception that the first system in the list MUST be the
+                                                            ____
        one that is in the ring AND has the attached node.  In this
        configuration, all devices and queues on the ring will be shared, and
        the attached node (not in the ring) will share devices and queues
        with the system it's linked to in the ring.  The attached node will
        not share devices and queues with any other systems in the ring.


        2.6.4  Configuring a 2-Node Point-To-Point Network
+              ___________________________________________

        This is the easiest network to configure.  If the systems are sharing
        devices and queues, both are listed in the system list on each system.
        The fastest system should be listed first.  If not sharing devices,
        the system list does not have to be created at all.










        Version 5.4                                                  Page    7



1


        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        2.6.5  Other Network Configurations
+              ____________________________

        If the network has a configuration other than the three listed above,
        it must be divided into different sections, where each section is
        either a ring, ring with attached node, or point-to-point link.  Then,
        each section is configured according to the rules above.  Again, at
        revision 19.3, the network should be configured as if it were a single
        ring, no matter what its actual layout is.


        2.6.6  Copying the Network Configuration to Other Systems
+              __________________________________________________

        After one system has been completely configured and the System
        Administrator is satisfied with its performance, other systems in the
        network will need to be configured.  To make this easier,
        INSTALL_PRINTMASTER asks if the configuration should be copied from
        another system in the network.  If it is, CONFIGURE_PRINTMASTER does
        not have to be run again.  The system list should have already been
        created on the system the configuration is being copied from.


        2.7  Installation - Phase 2
+            ______________________

        After deciding to use PrintMaster for all print operations, the
        installation program is run again, this time answering YES to the
        "Replace Prime spooler" question and NO to "Re-install new version".
        This will install CPL programs to emulate PROP and SPOOL, and an
        EPF library to replace SPOOL$.  A question will also be
        asked about enabling automated retraining.  Answering yes causes the
        PROP and SPOOL replacements to print the PrintMaster command
        corresponding to the PROP or SPOOL command given.  This will be
        helpful for a few weeks to allow users and operators to gradually
        switch to the new commands.  The Prime SPOOL and PROP commands are
        still available by including -PRIME on the new SPOOL and PROP command
        line.  This option causes the Prime versions of SPOOL and PROP
        to be run instead of the replacements.  Jobs cannot be added to the
        Prime spool queue once the SPOOL$ replacement is shared, since the
        Prime SPOOL command calls SPOOL$ to send files to the queue; while
        the PrintMaster SPOOL$ replacement is shared, the Prime SPOOL command
        will send files to PrintMaster queues!  If there are still jobs in
        the Prime spool queue, install the replacements and continue to run
        the Prime spool phantoms until the queues have been emptied.  This
        will require using the -PRIME option on all PROP commands to control
        devices.  All new jobs will be sent to the PrintMaster queue.  Once
        the Prime queue is empty and the spool phantoms are logged out, the
        corresponding PrintMaster devices can be started.

        IMPORTANT: Any programs that have already established dynamic
                   links to the old Prime SPOOL$ subroutine must be stopped
                   and restarted after installing phase II, for example,
                   the RJE workstation.

                                                                Keyword System



        3  THE KEYWORD SYSTEM
+          __________________

        PrintMaster uses keywords extensively to control its operation.  This
        is an important concept that must be understood to make effective use
        of the features in PrintMaster.


        3.1  Keywords
+            ________

        Keywords are used by Prime software to give commands additional
        information about how they should operate.  For example, the Prime
        SPOOL command has a keyword -FORM to tell the System Operator what
        form type should be used to print a file:

            OK, spool datafile -form white

        Another keyword is used to tell SPOOL to list the jobs in the queue:

            OK, spool -list

        PrintMaster uses keywords in a similiar manner, but allows keywords
        to be created and deleted by the System Administrator.


        3.1.1  What are keywords?
+              __________________

        There are three parts to a keyword: the keyword name, flags, and
        values.


        3.1.1.1  Keyword Names
+                _____________

        Keywords in PrintMaster always begin with a dash followed by a
        letter, period, or dollar sign.  Up to 31 letters, digits, or
        punctuation marks can follow this.  The only punctuation marks that
        can be used are the period, dollar sign, and underscore.  If a
        keyword has any other characters in it, such as a question mark, the
        error "Invalid keyword" is printed with a message describing what's
        invalid.  (too long, bad character, etc.)  Some examples of keywords
        are:

            -LINES_PER_PAGE
            -FORM
            -OPTION3
            -.status$kw4
            -.STATUS$KW4


        Lowercase and uppercase are treated the same in a keyword name, so
        the last two keywords are the same.





        Version 5.4                                                  Page    9

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        3.1.1.2  Keyword Validation
+                __________________

        PrintMaster commands only recognize certain keywords.  To detect
        keyword spelling and typing errors, a file of all legitimate keywords
        called the master keyword file is checked whenever a keyword is used.
        If the keyword is not in this file, the error "Undefined keyword"
        occurs.  The System Administrator may add and delete keywords from
        the master keyword file.


        3.1.1.3  Keyword Values
+                ______________

        Some keywords have extra information after them, such as the -FORM
        keyword used above, called a value.  In the example, WHITE is the
        value of the -FORM keyword.  Keywords can have more than one value,
        listed one after another:

            OK, spool -list form stock

        Here, the -LIST keyword has two values, FORM and STOCK.  Unlike
        keywords, values can have up to 128 characters, and any character can
        be used.


        3.1.1.4  Keyword Flags
+                _____________

        Sometimes a keyword is used for different purposes, depending on how
        the System Administrator wants PrintMaster to operate.  Keyword flags
        are used for this.  They print at the end of a keyword, following a
        colon.  There are three keyword flags - :i indicates a keyword is
        used for information only (not job scheduling), :p indicates a
        keyword is protected and cannot be modified or deleted, and :a
        indicates a keyword is an abbreviation for another keyword.
        Examples:

            -USER:i JIM_SMITH
            -PRIORITY:ip 5
            -FORM WHITE
            -AT:p SYSTEM-B
            -AS:a JOB_NAME
            -NF:a NO_FORMAT

        If a keyword is not followed by any flags, such as -FORM in the
        example above, it is neither an information keyword, an abbreviation,
        nor a protected keyword.  Keyword flags are kept in the master keyword
        file and can only be changed by the System Administrator.









        Page   10                                                  Version 5.4

                                                                Keyword System



        3.1.2  What are keywords used for?
+              ___________________________

        PrintMaster uses keywords to control commands, describe how jobs are
        to be scheduled and printed, and describe printer characteristics and
        capabilities.   Most keywords can be classified into one of these
        three groups.  -LIST, -STATUS, and -HELP are examples of command
        keywords; -FORM, -AT, and -FTN are job keywords, since they describe
        job characteristics; and -DEVICE_NAME, -UPPERCASE, and -AUTO_RESTART
        are examples of device keywords.  PrintMaster does not actually
        divide keywords into these three groups, but this grouping makes it
        easier to describe how they are used.


        3.1.3  Where do keywords come from?
+              ____________________________

        Keywords come from three places: command lines, keyword files, and
        system programs.  Keywords are most frequently used on Primos
        command lines.  For example,

            OK, apj datafile -form white -notify -at system_b

        This example has three keywords, -FORM, -NOTIFY, and -AT.  Long
        keyword sequences can be stored in keyword files to make PrintMaster
        easier to use.  All keywords in a keyword file are loaded whenever the
        -USING keyword is used:

            OK, apj datafile -using my_keywords

        (More information on creating and using keyword files is given in the
        KEYWORD  FILES section).

        The third keyword source is PrintMaster programs.  These keywords
        usually have fixed values such as a user's Primos user-id or the date
        a file was last modified, and they are included in every print job.


        3.1.4  Keyword abbreviations
+              _____________________


        PrintMaster allows for the creation and use of system-wide keyword
        abbreviations.  An abbreviation may be used in place of the name of a
        keyword in command line format; abbreviations are not allowed in text
        format (see KEYWORD LISTS - COMMAND LINE FORMAT for more information).
        Keyword abbreviations are created by the System Administrator and are
        maintained in the master keyword file.

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        3.2  Keyword Lists
+            _____________

        A keyword list is a group of keywords, along with their values and
        flags.  The list can come from keywords on the command line, from
        keyword files, or from system programs.  There is no limit on the
        number of keywords in a keyword list.  Keyword lists are ideal for
        representing jobs and devices, since keywords can be added and
        deleted dynamically, and any kind of information can be stored in
        keyword values.


        3.2.1  What are keyword lists used for?
+              ________________________________

        Keyword lists are used in PrintMaster to represent print jobs and
        printer devices.  A job's keyword list has all of the information
        about the job, such as: the pathname of the file to print, file size,
        date last modified, user spooling the file, and the system the file
        was spooled from.  Device keyword lists have information describing
        the Primos device used (PR0, PR1, etc.), whether the device has
        lowercase characters, and the current form type and attributes.  Each
        piece of information is associated with a particular keyword; the
        job's pathname is the value of the keyword -PATHNAME; the device's
        current form type is the value of the keyword -FORM.  Keyword lists
        are also used to determine which devices jobs can be printed on.  A
        job's keyword list must match a device's keyword list before it
+                               _____
        can be printed on that device.  The matching process is explained
        later.


        3.2.2  What do keyword lists look like?
+              ________________________________

        PrintMaster keyword lists have three representations: command line
        format is used on Primos command lines; text format is used when
        keyword lists are printed; and disk format is used to store keyword
        lists efficiently in disk files.


        3.2.2.1  Keyword Lists - Command Line Format
+                ___________________________________

        This is the most familiar form for keyword lists, and the simplest.
        Keywords are listed one after another in command line format.  Each
        keyword's name, flags, and values can be specified.  Flags are only
        used by the System Administrator when editing the master keyword
        file; it is an error for users to put flags on keywords.  Some
        examples of keyword lists in command line format:

            -form white -ftn -device_name pr0 pr1 pr2 -copyfile

            -select_jobs -form stock -user jimmy -select_kw -jobid -job_name

            -job 1 2 3 -notify now -dl -at Kansas




        Page   12                                                  Version 5.4

                                                                Keyword System



            -priority:ip 10 -form:p stock blank standard default -copyfile

        In the first example, the -FORM keyword has one value, WHITE;
        -DEVICE_NAME has three values: PR0, PR1, and PR2;  the -COPYFILE
        keyword has no values associated with it.  The last example shows how
        flags are put on keywords in command line format.  Again, these can
        only be used by the System Administrator when editing the master
        keyword file.  Since Primos treats some characters special on the
        command line, such as the comma and space, a value may have to be
        quoted with single quotes if it contains punctuation marks.  These
        quotes are not part of the value.  If quotes are not used, all
        letters in the value are changed to uppercase.  So, -FORM WHITE is
        the same as -form 'WHITE', but not the same as -FORM 'white'.

        In command line format abbreviations may be used for the name of the
        keyword.  For example, if -NF is a valid abbreviation for the keyword
        -NO_FORMAT and -AS is an abbreviation for -JOB_NAME then the command
        line:

            -as my_report -nf

        would be converted to:

            -job_name my_report -no_format

        (See KEYWORD ABBREVIATIONS for more information.)


        3.2.2.2  Keyword Lists - Text Format
+                ___________________________

        Keyword lists are printed in text format when they are listed for
        inspection or editing.  Many programs, such as the keyword file
        editor, queue lister, and device command program, print keyword lists
        in this form.  It is similar to command line format, except keywords
        and values are listed on separate lines rather than one after
        another.  Flags are listed immediately following the keyword, as in
        the command line format.  An example of a keyword list in text format
        is:

        This keyword list has seven keywords.  Three (-WRAP, -FORM, and
        -LINES_PER_INCH) have flags on them.  All but -WRAP have values.  The
        first value may be listed immediately after the keyword (and one
        space) or on the next line.  The entire line (except for the keyword)
        is taken as the value.  For example, the keyword -CARRIAGE_TAPE only
        has one value, standard tape.  In command line format, this would be
        considered two separate values, since it is not quoted.  The second
        and subsequent values are listed on the following lines, one per line,
        and do not begin with a dash. The -FORM keyword in this example
+           ______
        has five values.  If a keyword list in TEXT format is displayed on the
        terminal, the information keywords are printed first followed by the
        non-information or scheduling keywords.  Each group is sorted
        alphabetically.  Keywords are indented a few spaces and any values
        appearing on separate lines are indented three spaces more than the
        keywords.  However, when a keyword list in TEXT format is written to a
        file, the order is not changed and no indenting is done.  Files
        containing keyword lists in TEXT format always have the .TF suffix.


        3.2.2.3  Keyword Lists - Disk Format
+                ___________________________

        Keyword lists are stored on disk in a format that uses little space
        and is easy (for computers) to access.  Keyword files are stored this
        way.  The actual format is not important, but it is important that
        programs such as ED are not used to modify them, as they will make
        the file unreadable.  Only the PrintMaster keyword file editor EKF
        can modify keyword lists in disk format.  Job keyword lists in the
        print queue are also stored in disk format.  When keyword lists in
        DISK format are written to a file, the filename always has the .KF
        suffix.


        3.2.3  Matching Keyword Lists
+              ______________________

        Earlier it was mentioned that the job and device keyword lists must
        match for a job to be printed on a device.  This means that all of
        the job's scheduling keywords (not information-only; remember the :i
        flag) are in the device's keyword list, and the corresponding values
        also match.  Values match if either the device or job keyword has no
        values, or one of the job keyword's values is listed among the device
        keyword's values.  For example, a job with the keyword -FORM (no
        values) would match any device with the -FORM keyword, no matter what
        values (if any) it had; a job with the keyword -FORM STOCK would
        match a device with -FORM (no values), -FORM STOCK, or -FORM STOCK
        LARGE DEFAULT (3 values);  a job with the keyword -FORM STOCK LARGE
        (2 values) would match a device with -FORM (no values) or -FORM with
        either STOCK or LARGE among its values.  It is important to realize
        that keyword list matching is not symmetric, and that job keyword
        lists have to match device keyword lists, not the reverse.  For
        example, if a device has the keyword -FORM ABC DEF (2 values) and a
        job doesn't have the -FORM keyword, the job matches the device.  But,
        if the job has the keyword -FORM ABC DEF and the device doesn't have



        Page   14                                                  Version 5.4

        the -FORM keyword, the job doesn't match the device; the device DOES
        match the job, but this has no practical use.  Keyword list matching
        is an important feature used to implement PrintMaster's job
        scheduling flexibility.


        3.2.4  Editing Keyword Lists
+              _____________________

        Another operation performed on keyword lists, besides matching, is
        editing.  This is where one keyword list called the edit list is used
        to modify, or edit, another keyword list called the original list.
        The edit list is processed left to right, and each edit keyword is
        either inserted in or removed from the original list.


        3.2.4.1  Inserting Keywords into a Keyword List
+                ______________________________________

        If the keyword in the edit keyword list was already in the original
        list, it is removed first, along with all values.  The edit keyword
        and its values are then added to the original list.  Here are some
        examples of how keyword list editing works:

            Original List           Edit List        Result

            -STATUS -TRASH          -FORM ABC        -STATUS -TRASH -FORM ABC
            -FORM JUNK MAIL -TRASH  -FORM ABC        -TRASH -FORM ABC
            -FORM JUNK MAIL -TRASH  -FORM A B C      -TRASH -FORM A B C
            -AT SYS1 -FORM X Y      -FORM A B C      -AT SYS1 -FORM A B C
            -FTN -NO_HEADER         -FORM            -FTN -NO_HEADER -FORM
            -FORM XYZ -FTN          -FORM            -FTN -FORM



        3.2.4.2  Removing Keywords from a Keyword List
+                _____________________________________

        To remove keywords from a keyword list, a special form of the keyword
        is used in the edit list: the dash is followed by a carot (^), then
        the keyword name.  When this is used, the keyword and all of its
        values are removed from the keyword list.  For example,

             Original List        Edit List                Result

            -CHECK -NO_FORMAT    -DL -^CHECK -^WRAP       -DL -NO_FORMAT
            -CHECK STUB -FTN     -FORM ABC -^CHECK -XYZ   -FORM ABC -XYZ -FTN

        No error message is printed if the keyword to be deleted is not found
        in the original list.  In the last example, -CHECK and its values
        have been removed.  The keywords -FORM and -XYZ were inserted, since
        they did not have a carot following the dash.

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        3.2.4.3  Write-protected Keywords
+                ________________________

        The keyword flag :p means a keyword is protected.  This prevents
        modification of the keyword during editing.  If the original keyword
        list is -FORM:p ABC -FILL, and the edit list is -^FORM or -FORM DEF,
        an error will occur, since the -FORM keyword is protected and cannot
        be changed or deleted.  Unfortunately, an error is also printed if
        -FORM ABC is used to edit -STATE -FORM:p ABC -WAIT, even though the
        keyword is not being removed, and the value is the same.  To make
        this less of a problem, it is okay to change a protected keyword
+                                             ______
        that has no values, but it cannot be deleted.  This allows a
+                                            _______
        protected keyword to be specified more than once, something that is
        important when system, project, and user default keyword files are
        used.  These files are discussed in the next section.  Remember, the
        System Administrator sets keyword flags in the master keyword file;
        users cannot unprotect a protected keyword.


        3.3  Keyword Files
+            _____________

        Keyword files are used to store keyword lists in Primos disk files in
        the keyword list disk format.  Their filenames always have the .KF
        suffix.  The entire list of keywords is referenced with -USING
        followed by the keyword file pathname.  Keyword files are created
        with the keyword file editor EKF.  PrintMaster has default keyword
        files that are inserted into all print jobs.  These are created by
        the System Administrator, and allow, for example, all payroll reports
        to be printed at priority 10, while other reports are printed at
        priority 5. Before explaining keyword files further, a clear
        understanding of how -USING works is needed.


        3.3.1  The Special Keyword -USING
+              __________________________

        As stated earlier, keyword lists are used to represent jobs and
        devices.  The most common operation in PrintMaster is the creation
        and queueing of print jobs with the APJ command.  This command is
        documented extensively later in this manual, but basically, all
        keywords on the APJ command line are used to create the keyword list
        that will represent the job.  The APJ command will always put some
        keywords in the job keyword list, such as -USER and -PATHNAME; the
        user then edits this list, as described in the section on keyword
        list editing, with keywords on the command line.  For example, the
        command:

            OK, apj datafile -form stock
            [Add Print Job 2.0]
            Job 537 DATAFILE added to queue SYS.
            OK,

        would insert the -FORM keyword into the job's keyword list, causing
        the job to be printed on the form type STOCK.  Long or frequently used



        Page   16                                                  Version 5.4

                                                                Keyword System



        sequences of keywords, such as -FORM STOCK -NO_FORMAT -NOTIFY -DL,
        can be stored in a keyword file.  All keywords in the file are
        inserted with the -USING keyword like a macro, for example:

            OK, apj datafile -using my_kf1 my_keyword_file2
            [Add Print Job 2.0]
            Job 538 DATAFILE added to queue SYS.
            OK,

        The result is as if all keywords in the keyword files MY_KF2.KF and
        MY_KEYWORD_FILE2.KF had been typed in explicitly on the command line.
        As mentioned earlier, keyword lists are always processed left to
        right.  The keyword -USING is expanded when it is encountered.  (the
        exception to this is the EKF command, which never expands -USING.)
+                                                   _____
        The -USING keyword can also be used inside a keyword file.  When this
        file is mentioned in a -USING value, the second keyword file will be
        read, and its keywords will be inserted.  So, if keyword file A.KF
        looks like this:

            -FORM STOCK
            -USING B
            -FTN

        and keyword file B.KF looks like this:

            -FORM TRASH
            -PRIORITY 10

        the command:

            OK, apj datafile -using a
            [Add Print Job 2.0]
            Job 539 DATAFILE added to queue SYS.
            OK,

        would insert -FORM STOCK from A.KF, then -FORM TRASH and -PRIORITY 10
        from B.KF, then -FTN from A.KF.  The job would be printed on -FORM
        TRASH, since it would overwrite -FORM STOCK.  If the -FORM keyword
        was protected by the System Administrator, -FORM TRASH would not
+                                                                    ___
        overwrite -FORM STOCK, and an error message would be printed;
        messages are not printed if a keyword protection error occurs while a
        LIBRARY keyword file is being inserted, although the keyword is not
        overwritten.

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        3.3.2  Types of Keyword Files
+              ______________________

        There are six types of keyword files in PrintMaster: the master
        keyword file; system, project, and user defaults; library keyword
        files; and user keyword files.  All are stored in the same format,
        but are created by different people and used for different purposes.
        They are created, modified, and deleted with the keyword file editor,
        EKF.  This command is explained fully under section THE KEYWORD FILE
        EDITOR EKF.


        3.3.2.1  The Master Keyword File
+                _______________________

        The master keyword file, called MASTER.KF is stored in the
        PrintMaster system directory, PRINTMASTER*.  It is created during
        installation, and is modified by the System Administrator.  All valid
        keywords must be in the master keyword file.  Whenever a keyword is
        referenced, it is looked up in the master file,  and the protection
        and information flags are put on the keyword if necessary.


        3.3.2.2  Default Keyword Files
+                _____________________

        There are three types of default keyword files: system, project, and
        user defaults.  These are kept in the system directory PRINTMASTER*,
        and maintained by the System Administrator.  They are loaded, in
        order, whenever jobs are queued.  The system default file is
        SYSTEM_DEFAULTS.KF; the project default files are kept in the
        directory PRINTMASTER*>PROJECT_DEFAULTS, and have names like XXX.KF,
        where XXX is the Primos project name; the user default files are kept
        in the directory PRINTMASTER*>USER_DEFAULTS, and have names like
        YYY.KF, where YYY is the Primos user-id.  As an example, if user-id
        JOHN in project PROGRAMMING queues a print job, SYSTEM_DEFAULTS.KF,
        PROGRAMMING.KF, and JOHN.KF are all inserted into the job keyword
        list before the user's command line.  This allows keywords in the
+            ______
        default files to be overridden by users, unless protected by the
        System Administrator.


        3.3.2.3  Library Keyword Files
+                _____________________

        Keyword files that are referenced by many users can be put in the
        keyword library, PRINTMASTER*>LIBRARY, for easier access.  These
        files are loaded whenever a -USING value is not a pathname, and is
        not in the current directory.  For example, the command:

            OK, apj datafile -using stock

        will first check the current directory for a file named STOCK.KF, and
        if not found, will check in the keyword library.  Library keyword
        files are usually created by the System Administrator or System
        Operator; some users may also be granted access rights to the keyword

        library.


        3.3.2.4  User Keyword Files
+                __________________

        Users can make private keyword files to store frequently used keyword
        lists.  As with all other keyword files, they are created with the
        keyword file editor EKF, and can only contain valid keywords, i.e.,
        keywords in the master keyword file.  These are referenced with -USING
        followed by the pathname of the keyword file, for example:

            OK, apj DATAFILE -form stock -using john>my_keyword_file

        All keywords in JOHN>MY_KEYWORD_FILE.KF would be inserted in the job
        after system, project, user defaults and -FORM STOCK had been
        inserted.


        3.4  The Keyword File Editor EKF
+            ___________________________

        Keyword files are created, modified, and deleted with the keyword
        file editor, EKF.  This command is used to edit the master, library,
        and user keyword files, as well as the system, project, and user
        defaults.  The basic form of the command is:

            OK, ekf  keyword_file  command

        where KEYWORD_FILE is the file to edit, and COMMAND is the operation
        to perform.  If KEYWORD_FILE is omitted, EKF will print an error
        message; if COMMAND is omitted, EKF will assume the command -LIST or
        -EDIT.



        3.4.1  Specifying the Keyword File
+              ___________________________

        There are three ways to specify the keyword file: -MASTER or -M
        indicates the master keyword file PRINTMASTER*>MASTER.KF; this is
        normally used only by the System Administrator, although users may
        use it to list the valid keywords; a filename followed by -LIBRARY
        or -LIB indicates a library keyword file in the directory
        PRINTMASTER*>LIBRARY; for example, the command:

            OK, ekf stock -library

        would edit the library file STOCK (PRINTMASTER*>LIBRARY>STOCK.KF);
        the third way to indicate the keyword file is to use a pathname; this
        is probably the most common, for example:

            OK, ekf jim>keyword_macro_files>standard

        All keyword files have the .KF suffix; it is supplied by the system if



        Version 5.4                                                  Page   19

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        omitted.


        3.4.2  Specifying the Editing Command
+              ______________________________

        There are four command options for EKF: -CREATE creates a new keyword
        file; -DELETE deletes a keyword file; -EDIT modifies a keyword file;
        and -LIST prints a keyword file.  If the command is omitted, -LIST is
        assumed unless other keywords are used on the command line, in which
        case -EDIT is assumed.


        3.4.2.1  The EKF command -CREATE
+                _______________________

        This command creates a new keyword file.  It can be abbreviated to
        -C.  If the keyword file already exists, it is overwritten.  If
        nothing is given after the -CREATE command, EKF will enter an input
        loop to allow the user to type in the keywords, flags, and values to
        be put in the keyword file; the input prompt is a greater-than (>)
        symbol.  To stop the program, enter a carriage return following the
        prompt.  The keyword list is entered in text format (see KEYWORD LISTS
        - TEXT FORMAT), for example:

            OK, ekf jimmy>macro -create
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
            Please enter keyword list. The first item must be a keyword.
            > -status
            Undefined keyword "-STATUS".
            Item ignored.
            The next item must be a keyword.
            > -form abc
            > def
            > ghi
            > -using special
            > -notify now
            > -dl
            >
            OK,

        The error on -STATUS occurred because this keyword was not in the
        master keyword file.  The -FORM keyword has three values: abc, def,
        and ghi.  These are not mapped to uppercase, since this is only
+                           ___
        done when keywords are entered in command line format.  The -NOTIFY
        and -USING keywords have one value: now and special, respectively.
        These values could have been entered on a separate line.  The -DL
        keyword has no values.

        If an incorrect value is entered for a keyword, start over by
        re-entering the keyword, for example:

            OK, ekf jimmy>oops -create
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]

            Please enter keyword list. The first item must be a keyword.

        Here, -FORM xyz would have been stored in the keyword file.

        If an incorrect keyword has been entered, use the special form
        -^KEYWORD to remove it, for example:

            OK, ekf jimmy>oops -create
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
            Please enter keyword list. The first item must be a keyword.
            > -form abc
            > def
            > ghi
            > -notify now
            > -^form
            >
            OK,

        The keyword file OOPS.KF would only have the keyword -NOTIFY now in
        it, since -FORM was deleted.

        The -CREATE command can optionally be followed by either the pathname
        of a keyword list in TEXT format or a keyword list in command line
        format.  EKF will use the keywords in either list to create the new
        keyword file.  If a text file is given it must have the suffix .TF
        to distinguish it from a keyword file, which has the .KF suffix.  If
        the .TF is omitted, it is added by EKF.  For example:

            OK, slist jimmy>macro.tf
            -DL
            -FORM abc
            def
            ghi
            -NOTIFY now
            -USING special
            OK, ekf jimmy>macro -create jimmy>macro
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
            OK,

        This example would create the same keyword file as before.  The input
        file, JIMMY>MACRO.TF is read, and the keyword file JIMMY>MACRO.KF is
        created.  Blank lines are ignored while EKF is reading a text file.

        A keyword file can also be be created by giving the keyword list on
        command line:

               -FORM BLANK
               -AT Home
            OK,

        Notice that even though the value for -FORM, blank, was typed in lower
        case, it was changed to uppercase.  This is always the case with
        command line format values, unless single quotes are used.  See
        sections KEYWORD LISTS - COMMAND LINE FORMAT for more information.



        3.4.2.2  The EKF command -DELETE
+                _______________________

        This command deletes a keyword file.  It can be abbreviated to -D.
        For example:

            OK, ekf stock -lib -delete
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
            OK,

        deletes the library file PRINTMASTER*>LIBRARY>STOCK.KF.  The command:

            OK, ekf jimmy>macro -delete
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
            OK,

        deletes the user keyword file JIMMY>MACRO.KF.

        The Primos DELETE command can also be used to delete a keyword file.


        3.4.2.3  The EKF command -LIST
+                _____________________

        This command lists an existing keyword file in TEXT format.  It can
        be abbreviated to -L.  The output can be directed to the terminal or
        written to a file.  This example writes to the terminal:

            OK, ekf jimmy>macro -list
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
               -DL
               -FORM
                  abc
                  def
                  ghi
               -NOTIFY now
               -USING special

                                                                Keyword System



            OK,

        When a keyword file is printed on the terminal the keywords are
        indented a few spaces and sorted in alphabetical order, with
        information keywords (followed by :i flag) listed before scheduling
        keywords, and the values of any keyword with multiple values are
        indented three spaces more than the keywords.

        To write the list to a text file, the -LIST command is followed by a
        pathname, for example:

            OK, ekf jimmy>macro -list jimmy>macro.tf
+               ____________________________________
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
            OK, slist jimmy>macro.tf
+               ____________________
            -DL
            -FORM abc
            def
            ghi
            -NOTIFY now
            -USING special
            OK,

        The .TF suffix on the listing pathname is optional, and will be added
        by EKF if omitted.  No sorting or indenting occurs when a keyword file
        is written to a text file, since this could change its meaning (i.e.
        if the -USING keyword is in the list).

        The -EXPAND option (abbreviated -EXP) can be used with -LIST.  It
        causes all -USING keywords to be expanded, for example:

            OK, ekf jimmy>macro -list
+               _____________________
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
               -DL
               -FORM
                  abc
                  def
                  ghi
               -NOTIFY now
               -USING special
            OK, ekf special -list

                  def

               -NOTIFY
               -NO_FORMAT

        The -LIST and -CREATE commands can be used together to modify keyword
        files.  First the -LIST command is used with output directed to a
        text file.  Next, a text editor such as ED is used to modify the text
        file.  Then the EKF -CREATE command is used to re-create the keyword
        file from the text file.  For example (user input is underlined):


             OK, ed jimmy>macro.tf
+                _________________
             EDIT

             def

             t

             n

             -DL
             l -NOTIFY

             -NOTIFY now
             c/now//

             OK,

        This may be the best way to edit a long or complex keyword file,
        especially if many changes are needed.  An easier way to make quick
        changes is to use the keyword file editor command -EDIT.


        3.4.2.4  The EKF command -EDIT
+                _____________________

        This command is used to modify an existing keyword file or create a
        new one.  It can be abbreviated to -E.  Like the -CREATE command, this
        command may be followed by the pathname of a keyword list in TEXT
        format, by a keyword list in command line format, or by nothing
        (indicating that the keyword list will be entered from the terminal).
        EKF uses the keyword list given to edit the keyword file's keyword
        list.  In the -LIST example above, the value "now" was removed from
        the -NOTIFY keyword.  This could have been done easily with -EDIT
        (user input is underlined):

        This could also have been done on the command line:

            ekf jimmy>macro -edit -notify

        Keywords can be deleted using the carot in the edit list:

                  def
                  ghi

               -NOTIFY
               -SUSPENDABLE
            OK,

        Notice that even though the two values for -FORM, jkl and mnop, were
        typed in lower case, they were changed to uppercase.  This is always
        the case with command line format values, unless single quotes are
        used.  See section KEYWORD LISTS - COMMAND LINE FORMAT for more
        information.

        3.4.2.5  EKF and the MASTER keyword file
+                _______________________________


        EKF allows the master keyword file to be specified with the -Master
        option or by entering its pathname (PRINTMASTER*>MASTER).  Both forms
        have the same effect:  the master keyword file is modified and the
        internal version is reloaded in the shared segment; new keywords are
        immediately available.  However, if a pathname is used to specify the
        master keyword file on a remote system, the internal version will not
        be reloaded on the remote system (since it resides in a shared
        segment).  EKF must be run ON THE REMOTE SYSTEM to cause the new
        master list to be reloaded.

        Extreme caution should be exercised when manipulating the master
        keyword file.  Due to the importance of the master keyword file, EKF
        takes special precautions when it is manipulated.  When either the
        -CREATE or -DELETE command is used, EKF will request verification.

        3.5  Creating new keyword abbreviations
+            __________________________________


        Abbreviations for commonly used keywords may be created by the System
        Adminstrator.  An abbreviation is simply a keyword, with one value,
        that may be used in place of another keyword when entering a keyword
        list in command line format.  The value of an abbreviation is the
        name of the keyword that will be inserted whenever the abbreviation is
        used.  Abbreviations are created in the master keyword file and are
        designated by the :a flag.  The following sequence shows how to create
        abbreviations for the keywords:  -JOB_NAME, -LINE_NUMBERS, and
        -COPIES:

            OK, ekf -m -edit
            [Edit Keyword File 3.2]
            > -as:a job_name
            > -ln:a line_numbers
            > -c:a copies
            >
            OK,

        Note, EKF does not check to see if the value given is a valid keyword;
        instead, the value is checked when the abbreviation is expanded.

        The following abbreviations have already been included in the master
        keyword file:

            Abbreviation     Keyword
            -AS              -JOB_NAME
            -CF              -COPYFILE

        4  APJ - Add Print Job
+          ___________________

        This command is used to queue files for printing.  It has the
        following basic forms:

           (1)  APJ  pathname  options
           (2)  APJ  -OPEN unit  options
           (3)  APJ  -HELP

        In the first form, PATHNAME will be queued for printing.  In the
        second form, a job will be added to the queue and a file will be
        opened for writing on UNIT; if UNIT is not given, unit 2 will be
        used.

        This is equivalent to the following SPOOL commands:

           (1)  SPOOL  pathname  options
           (2)  SPOOL  -OPEN  options
                SPOOL  -OPEN  -TUNIT unit

        The job keyword list is created in 6 steps:

           (1)  Default keywords are inserted
           (2)  JOB_KEYWORDS are taken from the value of the global variable
                 ".APJ_DEFAULTS" if it exists; keywords are in command line
                 format.
           (3)  Finally, OPTIONS from the command line are inserted.


        4.1  Optional Job Keywords
+            _____________________


           -ACCT_INFO  Causes a user-defined message to be written with the
                       accounting record for this job.  It has the form:

                          -ACCT_INFO message

           -ACCOUNTING Causes paper usage accounting to be enabled for the job
        .

           -AT         Forces the job to be printed on a device at one of the
                       specified destinations.  It has the form:

                          -AT dest1 dest2 ...

                       Each DEST must be a valid destination (see your System
                       Administrator for these).

                       This is similar to Prime's -AT option.

           -BANNER     Prints a message on the banner page.  It has two forms
                       on the command line:

                          (2)  -BANNER

                       In form one, up to 10 single quoted message lines may
                       be given.

                       In form two, APJ will prompt you with ">" and ask for
                       the message.  You may enter up to 10 lines, entering a
                       blank line to terminate the message.

                       Message lines can be up to 80 characters long.

           -CHARS_PER_LINE
                       Sets the number of characters to be printed per line.
                       Lines longer than this will be wrapped around, or
                       truncated depending on whether -WRAP and -TRUNCATE are
                       used.  It has the form:

                          -CHARS_PER_LINE n

                       N must be greater than zero and less than 500.
                       This keyword overrides the device's value.

           -COPIES     Sets the number of copies to print.  It has the form:
           (abbr -CP)
                          -COPIES n

                       N must be greater than zero.  If this keyword is
                       omitted, one copy will be printed.

           -COPYFILE   Copies the print file to the queue.

                       If this keyword is omitted, a copy of the file is not
                       made in the print queue, and devices will print the job
                       from the original file.

                       This keyword is supplied automatically when the option
                       -OPEN is used.

           -DEADLINE   Sets the date/time the user wants the job to START
                       printing.  It has two forms:

                          (1)  -DEADLINE NOW
                          (2)  -DEADLINE date

                       In the first form, the starting deadline will be set
                       to the current date/time.  In the second form, the
                       deadline will be set to the date/time given.  DATE
                       must not have already elapsed and must be one of the
                       standard Primos forms:

                          (1)  YY-MM-DD.HH:MM:SS.DOW
                          (2)  MM/DD/YY.HH:MM:SS.DOW
                          (3)  DD MM YY HH:MM:SS DAY_OF_WEEK

                       Missing fields are automatically supplied with the
                       current time/date information.  Format 3 must be quoted
                       since it contains blanks.

                       When the deadline expires, the job will be printed on
                       the next available device (after, of course, any jobs
                       whose deadline expired earlier).

                       The job may print sooner than the deadline.

                       This keyword may not be used when the keyword -PRIORITY
                       has a value of zero.

           -DEFER      Defers the job until the specified date.  It has the
                       form:

                          -DEFER date

                       DATE must be one of the standard Primos date forms (see
                       option -DEADLINE) and must not have already elapsed.

                       This is similar to Prime's -DEFER option.

           -DEVICE_NAME
                       Forces the job to be printed on one of the devices
                       specified.  It has the form:

                          -DEVICE_NAME name1 name2 ...

                       Each NAME must be a valid device name (see your System
                       Administrator for these).

           -DL         Deletes the original file after successfully printing
                       the last copy.  This requires D access to the parent
                       directory.  The file will not be deleted if it is
                       delete protected, or if -DL is removed from the job
                       while it is printing.

           -FORM       Forces the job to be printed on one of the form types
           (abbr -FM)  listed.  It has the form:

                          -FORM type1 type2 ...

                       Each TYPE must be a system defined FORM type (see your
                       System Administrator for these).

                       This is similar to Prime's -FORM option.

           -FTN        Prints the job in FTN format, with carriage control in
                       column 1.  Carriage control characters recognized are:

                                 +       skip zero lines
                               space     skip 1 line
                                 0       skip 2 lines
                                 -       skip 3 lines
                                 1       skip to channel 1 (page eject)
                                 2       skip to channel 2 (etc. to channel 9)
                                 A       skip to channel 10
                                 B       skip to channel 11
                                 C       skip to channel 12
                               other     skip 1 line

           -HOLD       Holds the job until released by either the user or
                       operator.

           -JOB_NAME   Sets the name of the job.  It has the form:
           (abbr -AS)
                          -JOB_NAME print_name

                       If this keyword is omitted, PRINT_NAME will be set to
                       the filename portion of the job's pathname.  If the
                       option -OPEN is used, PRINT_NAME will be set to blanks.

                       This is similar to Prime's -ALIAS (or -AS) option.

           -LINES_PER_PAGE
                       Sets the number of print lines on the page.  It has the
                       form:

                          -LINES_PER_PAGE n

                       N must be greater than zero.
                       This keyword overrides the device's value.

           -LINE_NUMBERS
           (abbr -LN)  Prints line numbers on the left edge of the page.

                       Line numbers will only be printed in PAGED mode and
                       NO_FORMAT mode.

                       This is similar to Prime's -LNUM option.

           -NO_BANNER  Suppresses job information on the banner page.
           (abbr -NB)
                       The user banner message (see option -BANNER) will still
                       be printed.  If no user message is given, no banner
                       page will be printed.

                       This is similar to Prime's -NOHDR option, except a
                       blank page is not printed.



        Version 5.4                                                  Page   31

           -NO_FORMAT  Prints the job in Prime's no format mode.
           (abbr -NF)
                       This is similar to Prime's -NOFMT option.

           -NO_WAIT    Allows the job to begin printing while it is still
                       being written.

                       If the option -COPYFILE is not used, the file's read/
                       write lock must be UPDT or NONE to allow the device
                       to open the file for reading while it is open
                       for writing.  If this is NOT done, the job will be
                       printed when it is closed.

                       This is especially useful for RJE jobs, since the job
                       can begin printing while still being transmitted.

           -NOTE       Puts a note to the operator on the job.  It has the
                       same form and restrictions as -BANNER.

           -NOTIFY     Notifies the user when the job is completed.  It has
                       two forms:

                          (1)  -NOTIFY
                          (2)  -NOTIFY NOW

                       The device will send the user a message via the Primos
                       MESSAGE facility after the last copy has been printed.
                       If form one is used, the message will be deferred.  If
                       form two is used, the message will be sent immediately
                       if possible, and deferred otherwise.

           -PAGE_HEADER
           (abbr -PH)  Sets the page header line in PAGED mode.  It has the
                       form:

                          -PAGE_HEADER message

                       MESSAGE must be quoted if it contains blanks.  If
                       MESSAGE is blank, no page header will be printed.

                       If this keyword is omitted, the default page header
                       "<pathname>, -- Last modified <date>" will be printed.

           -PARALLEL   Allows multiple copies to be printed simultaneously
                       on different printers.

           -PAUSE_EJECT
                       Forces the job to be printed on a device that has sheet
                       feed capability.  It has two forms:

                          (1)  -PAUSE_EJECT



        Page   32                                                  Version 5.4

                          (2)  -PAUSE_EJECT RING

                       Sheet feeding is only supported on TTY devices.  Both
                       forms will cause the device to pause after each page
                       until a character is typed.  In the second form, in
                       addition to pausing, the bell will ring.

           -PRIORITY   Sets the job's priority.  It has the form:
           (abbr -PR)
                          -PRIORITY n

                       N must be greater than or equal to zero and less than
                       1000.  If N is zero, the job will be scheduled in
                       first-in-first-out fashion with all other priority zero
                       jobs.  If N is not zero, the job with the largest
                       priority will be printed first.  The option -DEADLINE
                       may not be used with priority zero jobs.

                       This keyword is required for all jobs.

           -QUEUE      Specifies the queue to put the job in.  It has the
                       form:

                          -QUEUE queue_partition

                       If this keyword is omitted, the job will be added to
                       the first queue found.

                       If the print queue is moved to another partition, the
                       value for this keyword will automatically be adjusted.

                       This keyword is restricted to the command line and may
                       not appear in a keyword file.

           -QUIET      Supresses the printing of any messages in large
                       (banner) letters during device positioning.

                       This is useful for forms with sequence numbers, e.g.
                       payroll checks.

           -SET_VAR    Sets a global variable to the JOB_ID of the job added.
           (or -SV)    It has the form:

                          -SET_VAR global_variable

                       For example:

                          OK, APJ MY_FILE -SV .MY_JOB_ID
                          [Add Print Job 2.0]
                          Job 0 MY_FILE added to queue SYS.
                          OK, TYPE My job is number %.my_job_id%.
                          My job is number 0.
                          OK,

                       This keyword is restricted to the command line and may
                       not appear in a keyword file.

           -SUSPENDABLE
                       Indicates that copies of the job may be suspended.
                       If a copy is suspended by the operator or interrupted
                       by a hardware failure, it will resume printing at the
                       top of the page that was printing when the copy was
                       suspended.  This is especially useful when working
                       with large print files.  For example:

                          (1)  Operators may suspend large jobs to allow
                               smaller or more important jobs to print.
                          (2)  Jobs may be resumed after problems like system
                               halts and network/RJE errors.

                       If this keyword is omitted, the job is not suspendable
                       and will be RESTARTED after a network/RJE error.  This
                       is how Prime's spooler works.

           -TRUNCATE   Causes the device to truncate any line which is longer
                       than the paper width (value of -CHARS_PER_LINE).

           -UPPERCASE  Forces the job to be printed on a device that prints in
                       uppercase only.

           -WRAP       Wraps lines whose length exceeds the line length given
                       by the -CHARS_PER_LINE keyword, or the device's default
                       line length if this keyword is omitted.

                       Lines are ALWAYS truncated after 500 characters.

                                                           APJ - Add Print Job



        4.2  Job Keywords Always Inserted by APJ
+            ___________________________________

        As mentioned above, the job keyword list is created in 5 steps.  In
        step 1, internal keywords are inserted by the APJ command.  The
        following is a list of those keywords.


           -COPIES_COMPLETED
                       This is the number of copies that have been completed.
                       Set to zero initially, it is updated when a device
                       completes a copy.  It has the form:

                          -COPIES_COMPLETED n

                       N is greater than or equal to zero.

           -COPIES_LEFT
                       This is the number of copies that are left to print.
                       Set to the number of copies requested initially, it is
                       updated when a device completes a copy.  It has the
                       form:

                          -COPIES_LEFT n

                       N is greater than zero.

           -COPIES_PRINTING
                       This is the number of copies that are currently
                       printing.  Set to zero initially, it is updated when
                       a device begins a copy.  It has the form:

                          -COPIES_PRINTING n

                       N is greater than or equal to zero.

                       N may be incorrect if a system error occurs while the
                       job is printing (e.g. Primos file system errors).

           -DATE_MODIFIED
                       This is the date/time that the print file was last
                       modified.  It has the form:

                          -DT_MODIFIED date

                       DATE is of the form:

                          DD MON YY HH:MM:SS: DAY_OF_WEEK

           -DATE_QUEUED
                       This is the date/time that the job was queued.
                       It has the same form as -DATE_MODIFIED.

           -JOBID      This is the job's number in the queue.  It has the
                       form:

                          -JOBID n

                       N is greater than or equal to zero.

           -PATHNAME   This is the pathname of the print file.  It has the
                       form:

                          -PATHNAME pathname

                       PATHNAME is a complete Primos pathname.  If the option
                       -OPEN is used, PATHNAME will be set to:

                          File opened in Print Queue

           -PROJECT    This is the Primos project of the user submitting the
                       job.  It has the form:

                          -PROJECT name

           -SIZE       This is the size of the print file rounded to the
                       nearest disk record.  It has the form:

                          -SIZE n

                       If the option -OPEN is used, N is the current size of
                       the print file.  This will be preceeded by a plus sign
                       (+) if the job is still being written.

           -USER_SYSTEM
                       This is the Primos system id of the user submitting the
                       job.  It has the form:

                          -USER_SYSTEM name

           -USER       This is the user id of the user submitting the job.  It
                       has the form:

        5  CPJ - Change Print Job
+          ______________________

        This command is used to change the keyword list of jobs already
        queued.  It has the following basic forms:

           (1)   CPJ  job_list  queue_option  edit_keywords
           (2)   CPJ  -HELP

        In the first form, JOB_LIST is a list of the id numbers of the jobs to
        change.  Up to 10 jobs may by changed with one command.  JOB_LIST has
        the form:

           -JOB jobid_1 ... jobid_10

        Job id's must be greater than or equal to zero.  JOBID_1 is required;
        JOBID_2 through JOBID_10 are optional.

        QUEUE_OPTION gives the partition of the print queue in which jobs are
        to be changed.  This is optional and has the form:

           -QUEUE partition

        If this keyword is omitted, the first print queue that is found will
        be used.

        EDIT_KEYWORDS is a keyword list that is used to EDIT the keyword lists
        of the jobs specified (see EDITING KEYWORD LISTS).  The keywords in a
        job keyword list may be separated into 2 groups:

           (1)  Internally protected, system-defined keywords
           (2)  All other keywords

        Keywords in group 1, internally protected, system-defined keywords,
        may not be changed or modified in any way.  An attempt to do so will
        cause an error message to be printed.  The keywords in this group
        include:

                       -COPIES_LEFT            -PATHNAME
                       -COPIES_PRINTING        -PROJECT
                       -COPIES_COMPLETED       -QUEUE
                       -COPYFILE               -SIZE
                       -DT_MODIFIED            -SYSTEM
                       -DT_QUEUED              -TRANID
                       -JOBID                  -UNIQUE_ID
                       -NO_WAIT                -USER

        Keywords in the other group include any site-defined keywords and all
        unprotected system-defined keyword (see APJ for a list of
        system-defined  keywords), with the exception of the ones listed
        above and those restricted to the APJ command line.

        Operators may change any job in any queue.

        Except for -DL and -NOTIFY, changing the job keyword list will only
        affect copies which are not currently printing.

        6  DPJ - Delete Print Job
+          ______________________

        This command is used to delete jobs from the print queue.  It has the
        following basic forms:

           (1)  DPJ  job_list  queue_option
           (2)  DPJ  -HELP

        In the first form, JOB_LIST is a list of the id numbers of the jobs to
        delete.  Users or operators may delete up to 10 jobs at once.
        JOB_LIST has the form:

           jobid_1 ... jobid_10

        Job id's must be greater than or equal to zero.  JOBID_1 is required;
        JOBID_2 through JOBID_10 are optional.

        This is equivalent to the SPOOL command:

           SPOOL -CANCEL jobid_1 ... jobid_10

        QUEUE_OPTION gives the partition of the print queue that jobs are to
        be deleted from.  This is optional and has the form:

           -QUEUE partition

        If this keyword is omitted, the first print queue that is found will
        be used.

        Users may only delete their own jobs; that is, ones that have the same
        USER and PROJECT id.  Operators may delete any job.

        When a job is deleted, any copies currently printing will be dropped.

        7  LPJ - List Print Job
+          ____________________

        This command is used to print the keyword list of jobs already queued.
        It has the following basic forms:

           (1)  LPJ  job_id  -LIST pathname  queue_option
           (2)  LPJ  -HELP

        In the first form, the keyword list of the job with the id JOB_ID will
        be listed.  If the option -LIST is used, the keyword list will be
        written to the file PATHNAME, otherwise it will be printed on the
        user's terminal.  The keyword list is printed in TEXT format.  (see
        KEYWORD LISTS - TEXT FORMAT for a description of text format.)

        QUEUE_OPTION specifies the print queue to use.  This is optional and
        has the form:

           -QUEUE partition

        If this keyword is omitted, the first print queue found will be used.

        8  LPQ - List Print Queue
+          ______________________

        This command is used to list, in tabular form, certain keywords of
        certain jobs in a print queue.  It has the following forms:

           (1)  LPQ  queue_option  select_option
           (2)  LPQ  -HELP

        QUEUE_OPTION specifies the queue or queues to be listed.  It is
        optional and has the form:

           -ALL                 List all queues, this is equivalent to the
                                SPOOL command:  SPOOL -LIST *
           -QUEUE partition     List the print queue on the partition given.

        If this option is omitted, the first print queue found is listed, this
        is equivalent to the SPOOL command:  SPOOL -LIST

        SELECT_OPTION specifies which jobs to list.  Only jobs which "match"
        the keyword list given will be listed.  It is optional and has the
        following form:

           -SJ keyword_list

        For example:

           LPQ -SJ -FORM STOCK WHITE -USER MY_USER_ID

        This command will list all jobs on form STOCK or WHITE, submitted by
        the user MY_USER_ID.

        If keywords -USER, -PROJECT, or -SYSTEM are given without a value the
        program will supply default values.

        The values of the following keywords will be listed.  Values too long
        to fit in the field size are truncated.  To see the complete values,
        use LPJ.

           -AT
           -COPIES_LEFT
           -COPIES_PRINTING
           -COPIES_COMPLETED

           -USER
           -PRIORITY
           -SIZE                The value of this keyword is the size of the
                                print file in disk records.  If the value is
                                preceeded by a plus sign then the file is stil

                                                              PROP Replacement



        9  PROP replacement command
+          ________________________

        If PrintMaster has been configured to perform all print operations,
        Prime's PROP command will be replaced by a CPL program that
        translates PROP options into equivalent PrintMaster commands.  This
        allows a site to switch from Prime's spooler to PrintMaster without
        retraining operators or converting command files.  The new PROP
        command has the following basic forms:

           (1)  PROP  command_options  -PRIME
           (2)  PROP  command_options

        In the first form, the command will be passed as is to Prime's PROP
        command; this allows a site to completely switch to PrintMaster while
        the Prime's spoolers are emptying Prime's SPOOLQ.

        In the second form, the command will be translated into equivalent
        PrintMaster commands.  If your System Administrator has enabled
        automated retraining, the equivalent PrintMaster commands will be
        listed.  The following options are supported (any discrepancies are
        noted):

           OPTION                           DISCREPANCY
           -ABO, -ABORT
           -BAC, -BACKUP                    Will backup 3 printed pages.
           -CON, -CONTINUE
           -DIS, -DISPLAY                   Lists the devices keyword list.
           -DRO, -DROP                      Will drop all copies currently
                                            printing.
           -HAN, -HANG                      Pauses the device when it is idle.
           -HAN, -HANG NOw

                                            mode for the next N printed pages.
                                            (If N is omitted, 1 is assumed.)
           -RES, -RESTART
           -STA, -START
           -STO, -STOP                      Stops the device when it is idle.
           -STO, -STOP NOw
           -STO, -STOP FInish
           -STO, -STOP IDle


        The following commands are not supported:

           COMMAND           RECOMMENDED ACTION

           PROP -CREate      Use the CDD command.
           PROP -DELete      Use the Primos DELETE command.
           PROP -MODify      Use the DC -EDIT or -LOAD command.

        10  SPOOL replacement command
+           _________________________

        If PrintMaster has been configured to perform all print operations,
        Prime's SPOOL command will be replaced by a CPL program that
        translates SPOOL options into equivalent PrintMaster commands.  This
        allows a site to switch from Prime's spooler to PrintMaster without
        changing most command files and CPL programs or retraining users.  The
        new SPOOL command has the following basic forms:

           (1)  SPOOL  command_options  -PRIME
           (2)  SPOOL  command_options

        In the first form, the command will be passed as is to Prime's SPOOL
        command.  Note that jobs will always be added to the PrintMaster print
        queue, since Prime's SPOOL command calls the shared procedure SPOOL$,
        which has also been replaced.  However, options -LIST and -CANCEL will
        still list and modify Prime's spool queue.

        In the second form, the command will be translated into equivalent
        PrintMaster commands.  If your System Administrator has enabled
        automated retraining, the equivalent PrintMaster commands will be
        listed.  The following options are supported with any discrepancies
        noted:

                   OPTION                      DISCREPANCY

           -A, -AT destination
           -CA, -CAN, -CANCEL n1 ... n10    Only 10 jobs may be specified.
                                            Form "-CANCEL PRTxxx"  or
                                            "-CANCEL xxx" can be used.

           -D, -DE, -DEF, -DEFER time       If time has already elapsed, the
                                            job is NOT queued.  Prime's will
                                            assume next day printing.

           -F, -FT, -FTN
           -LI, -LIS, -LIST                 Only the following "-LIST" options
                                            are supported:
                                               -LIST
                                               -LIST *

        11  FORM DEFINITIONS
+           ________________

        In PrintMaster, form and device characteristics are maintained
        separately.  This eliminates redundancy by allowing several devices
        to share the same form definitions.  Also, should the form
        characteristics ever change, only the form definition file would need
        to be modified.


        11.1  System required keywords
+             ________________________

        The following keywords will be in every form definition file:

           -CHARS_PER_LINE
                       Sets the length of the print line.  It has the form:

                          -CHARS_PER_LINE n

                       N must be greater than zero.

                       N must be set to the last printable column on the
                       paper.  For long stock paper (14 x 11) this will
                       probably be 132; for narrow stock paper (8.5 x 11) this
                       will probably be between 75 and 80, depending on the
                       left edge alignment.

                       If the keyword -WRAP is in the job keyword list, then
                       lines longer than N will be wrapped; if -TRUNCATE is in
                       the job keyword list, then they will be truncated after
                       N characters.

                       This is similar to the WIDTH option in Prime's PROP
                       command.

           -LINES_PER_PAGE
                       Sets the number of physical lines on the paper.  It has
                       the form:

                          -LINES_PER_PAGE n

                       N must be greater than zero.

                       For long stock paper (14 x 11) at 6 lines per inch,
                       this will be 66; for short stock paper (11 x 8.5) at 8
                       lines per inch, this will be 68.

                       It is very important that this be set correctly,
                       because it is used in job positioning, PAGED mode
                       output, and EVFU set up on certain devices.

                       This is similar to the LINES option in Prime's PROP
                       command.

                                                              Form Definitions





        11.2  Site required keywords
+             ______________________

        Some sites may require special keywords to be added to their form
        definitions, for example, default fonts and margins.  These can be
        added when the form is created, or added later with EKF.

        11.3  Form definition files
+             _____________________

        A form definition file is used to store the form name, its synonyms,
        characters per line, lines per page, and optional site defined
        keywords.  A form definition file is used by the operator to inform a
        device of its current print characteristics (i.e. the form type, the
        paper dimensions, etc.).  For example, to load form STOCK on device
        PR0, the operator may type:

           OK, DC PR0 -LOAD STOCK    (This will be explained in detail later.)


        11.3.1  CFD - Create Form Definition
+               ____________________________

        This command is used to create form definition files.  It has the
        basic forms:

           (1)  CFD

           (2)  CFD  -HELP


        FORM_OPTION is optional; it has the form:

           -FORM type

        TYPE must be valid filename and less than 30 characters.

        If this option is given, the command will ask for the characteristics
        of this form type and stop; otherwise, the command will allow you to
        enter a series of form types.

        When entering a form definition file, you will be asked for the
        synonyms of the form, its lines per page, and characters per line.

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        11.3.2  Where are form definition files kept?
+               _____________________________________

        All form definition files are stored in the directory
        PRINTMASTER*>LIBRARY.  This allows the operator to mount a new form
        on a device without requiring him to use a pathname or be attached to
        some special directory.  To obtain a complete list of all form types,
        ATTACH to this directory and use the LD command.  A form file may be
        listed using the EKF -LIST command (see THE KEYWORD FILE EDITOR EKF).


        11.3.3  System required keywords
+               ________________________

        PrintMaster requires the following keyword in every form definition
        file:

           -FORM       Sets the form type and all of its synonyms.  It has the
                       form:

                          -FORM type synonym_1 synonym_2 ...  synonym_N

                       TYPE is required and must be a valid filename, less
                       than 30 characters.  SYNONYM_1 through SYNONYM_N are
                       optional and may have any value.  If users at your site
                       are accustomed to using form types which are not valid
                       filenames, they should be made synonyms.  For example:

                          -FORM STOCK ' '
                          -FORM NARROW_STOCK '8 X 11'
                          -FORM FOUR_PART_STOCK 4PRT

                       This is similar to the PROP environment options PAPER
                       and FORM.

                       When a device has the keyword -FORM A B C D in its
                       keyword list, it will print any jobs queued with form
                       type A, B, C, or D.

        11.3.4  Changing a form definition
+               __________________________

        There are two ways to change a form definition file.  The first
        method is to change the keyword file using the EKF command (see THE
        KEYWORD FILE EDITOR EKF).  The second way (and probably the easiest),
        is to run CFD and recreate the form.

        12  DEVICES
+           _______


        12.1  CDD - Create Device Definition
+             ______________________________

        This command is used to create devices.  It has the following basic
        forms:

           (1)  CDD

           (2)  CDD  -HELP


        When creating a device, you will be asked for several of its
        characteristics.  These include its name, destination, default FORM
        type, speed, job size limit, and its type.  You will also be asked for
        any special keywords that the device requires.

        If the default FORM type does not exist, you will be asked to either
        create it or select a different FORM type.  If you elect to create the
        FORM type, the command CFD (Create Form Definition) will be run.
        Should this fail for any reason, neither the FORM nor the DEVICE file
        will be created.

        The device's type describes the kind of printer being used (i.e.
        DataProducts, Printronix, etc.) and how it is connected to the system
        (i.e. AMLC, TTY, PARALLEL, etc.).  From the information supplied, CDD
        will determine the name of the level 3 device driver to use.  The
        following table lists the drivers known to CDD.

           DEVICE               NAME     COMMENTS

           DataProducts         L3$DP    Band printer supplied by Prime.
           Printronix           L3$PX    Dot matrix printer supplied by Prime.
           Xerox 2700-II        L3$X2700
           HP LaserJet          L3$LASERJET

        If the printer is of another type (i.e. a Versatec plotter, a
        terminal, an ordinary AMLC device, etc.), the standard level 3 driver,
        L3$STANDARD, is used.


        12.2  Changing a DEVICE definition
+             ____________________________

        There are two ways to change a DEVICE definition file.  The first
        method is to change the keyword file using the EKF command (see THE
        KEYWORD FILE EDITOR EKF).  The second way (and probably the easiest),
        is to rerun CDD and recreate the device.

        12.3  Device file organization
+             ________________________

        PrintMaster devices created by CDD use four files: a CPL program
        called the device startup file, a keyword file called the device
        definition file, a timed-out keyword file, and a Primos comoutput
        file.  These are completely documented in this section, although there
        is no need to reference them under normal circumstances.  All device
        files are kept in the system directory, PRINTMASTER*.  To obtain a
        complete list of all devices, ATTACH to PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES and use
        the LD command.


        12.3.1  DEVICE startup files
+               ____________________

        The device startup file is a CPL program that contains instructions
        to start a COMO file and invoke the device driver program.  It is
        created automatically by CDD when the device is created, and is named
        PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>XXX.CPL, where XXX is the device name.  A
        phantom is submitted by the monitor, using this file, in response to
        an operator START request (see DC, Device Command, for information on
        starting devices).  The phantom's user-id will be the same as the
        name of the device.


        12.3.2  DEVICE definition files
+               _______________________

        The second file is the DEVICE definition file.  This keyword file
        has keywords telling the device which physical device it is to
        assign, what its default form type is, the modes of operation
        allowed, and so on (see DEVICE KEYWORDS for a complete description).
        It has the pathname PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>XXX.KF, where XXX is the
        name of the device.  To list a DEVICE definition file, use the EKF
        -LIST command (see THE KEYWORD FILE EDITOR EKF).  For example:






















        Version 5.4                                                  Page   51

              PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>DEVICE_DEFAULTS.KF
              PRINTMASTER*>LIBRARY>STOCK
           OK,


        12.3.3  DEVICE time-out keyword files
+               _____________________________

        A feature of PrintMaster allows devices to time-out when idle (and log
        back in when there is work to do) and automatically restart after a
        system crash.  If a device is allowed to automatically restart or is
        currently timed-out, the device will have a special time-out keyword
        file with a copy of its current state.  This is to allow the device to
        be restarted when there is work for it, and have the same state as
        before it logged out or the system crashed.  The device's time-out
        keyword file is kept in the directory PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>TIMEOUT,
        and must not be modified in any way.


        12.3.4  DEVICE comoutput files
+               ______________________

        While a device is active, Primos error messages such as the print file
        was not available or was open, are written to a COMO file named
        PRINTMASTER*>COMO>XXX.COMO, where XXX is the device name.  This
        file should be checked if a device logs out unexpectedly or won't
        print jobs.  It can also be read while the device is active, if
        necessary.


        12.4  Keywords in the DEVICE definition file
+             ______________________________________

        The DEVICE definition file has keywords to describe all of the
        device characteristics.  These keywords may be broken into the
        following groups:

           (1)  Keywords recognized by the level 1 driver (all devices)
           (2)  Keywords recognized by the L2 driver (line-oriented devices)
           (3)  Keywords recognized by the level 3 driver
           (4)  Additional scheduling keywords (i.e. -FORM and -AT).

        12.4.1  Keywords recognized by the level 1 driver.
+               __________________________________________

        In general, the keywords recognized by the level 1 driver affect the
        device's mode of operation.  They determine the physical device used,
        the print mode (currently restricted to line-oriented), the name of
        the device, and so on.  These keywords may be divided into required
        and optional keywords.


        12.4.1.1  Keywords required by all devices
+                 ________________________________

        These keywords are required in all DEVICE definition files:

           -LEVEL_2_DRIVER
                       Sets the device print mode.  Currently the only mode
                       supported is a line-oriented print mode similar to the
                       current Prime spooler.  It has the form:

                          -LEVEL_2_DRIVER L2$MAIN

           -LEVEL_3_DRIVER
                       Determines the level 3 device driver to be used.  It
                       has the form:

                          -LEVEL_3_DRIVER name

                       (see CDD for an explaination and listing of level 3
                       device driver names).


        12.4.1.2  Optional keywords for all devices
+                 _________________________________

        The following keywords are optional:

           -ACCOUNTING Sets the name of the paper accounting procedure to be
                       called.  Currently only one procedure, L2$ACCOUNTING,
                       is supported.  It has the form:

                          -ACCOUNTING L2$ACCOUNTING

           -ASSIGN_DEVICE
                       Specifies the Primos device to assign when the
                       PrintMaster device is started.  It has the form:

                          -ASSIGN_DEVICE command

                       COMMAND is appended to "ASSIGN " and passed to Primos
                       to assign the device, for example:

                          -ASSIGN_DEVICE PR0
                          -ASSIGN_DEVICE AMLC TTY 77

                       (In the last example, 77 is the AMLC line number in
                       octal.)

           -AUTO_RESTART
                       Tells the device to automatically restart after system
                       crashes.

           -DEVICE_SPEED
                       Sets the device speed.  It has the form:

                          -DEVICE_SPEED n

                       N is a number 0-9999.  This is used to select the
                       fastest device available to print a job.  (devices with
                       higher speeds will be selected first).

           -DEVICE_UNIT
                       Sets the Primos device unit.  It has the form:

                          -DEVICE_UNIT n

                       N must be a valid Primos device unit.  For parallel
                       devices, N is:  0 for PR0, 1 for PR1, etc.; for
                       serial AMLC devices, N is the line number in
                       DECIMAL.  For example:

                          -DEVICE_UNIT 3
                          -ASSIGN_DEVICE PR3

                          -DEVICE_UNIT 63
                          -ASSIGN_DEVICE AMLC TTY 77

           -JOB_SIZE_LIMIT
                       Sets the maximum job size (in disk records) this device
                       will print.  It has the form:

                          -JOB_SIZE_LIMIT n

                       N is a number 0-32767 or the string NONE, in which case
                       there is no limit.


           -PARITY
                       Allows translation of parity bits on all data sent to
                       the device.  It has the form:

                          -PARITY type

                       TYPE is the kind of translation to perform:

                           ON      - turn parity bits on
                           OFF     - turn parity bits off

                           SAME    - do not change parity (default)
                           FLIP    - reverse parity bits

           -TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN
                       Tells the device to logout when it is idle.  It has the
                       form:

                          -TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN n

                       N must be greater than zero.  N is the number of
                       minutes that a device will remain idle before logging
                       out.  The device will be restarted by the monitor when
                       there is work for it.

           -UPPERCASE  Tells the device to uppercase all output.  This is also
                       a scheduling keyword, and allows the device to print
                       jobs queued with -UPPERCASE.

        Since it is desired that all devices act in the same manner, some of
        these keywords (i.e. -ACCOUNTING and -TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN) are kept
        in a special keyword file which is set up the by System Administrator
        when the system is configured and referenced by all devices when they
        startup.  When a DEVICE file is created, CDD will insert a reference
        to this special keyword file:

           -USING PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>DEVICE_DEFAULTS


        12.4.2  Keywords recognized by the L2 driver
+               ____________________________________

        L2$MAIN is the line-oriented, Prime compatible level 2 driver.  The
        keywords recognized by it affect the way the print file is
        interpreted.  They determine the banner letter character set used and
        the print formats enabled.  These keywords may be broken into two
        groups, required keywords and optional keywords.


        12.4.2.1  Keywords required by the L2 driver
+                 __________________________________

        The following keywords are required by all devices using the level 2
        driver:

           -BANNER_LETTER_FILE
                       Sets the banner letter character set.  It has the form:

                          -BANNER_LETTER_FILE pathname

                       The banner letter character set in PATHNAME is used
                       when printing the banner page and during device
                       positioning (see SYSTEM FILES AND DIRECTORIES in the
                       System Administrator's Guide for more information on
                       this file).

        (The following keywords are closely associated with the FORM type and
        are read from the FORM definition file when a FORM type is LOADED.)

           -CHARS_PER_LINE
                       Sets the maximum number of characters per print line.

           -LINES_PER_PAGE
                       Sets the number of print lines per page.


        12.4.2.2  Optional keywords recognized by the L2 driver
+                 _____________________________________________

        Since it is desired that all devices act in the same manner, the
        following keywords are kept in a special keyword file that is set up
        when the PrintMaster is shipped and updated by the System
        Administrator when the system is configured.  When a DEVICE is
        created, CDD will insert a reference to this file:

           -USING PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>L2

        This file may or may not contain the following keywords.  Each of
        these keywords tells the device that it has the capability of
        performing a particular function.  This list should not be changed
+                                          _______________________________
        unless the System Administrator wants to disable a feature of the

        12.4.3  Keywords recognized by the level 3 drivers
+               __________________________________________

        The keywords recognized by the level 3 drivers vary from driver to
        driver.  For example, some recognize these keywords:

           -CHECK_CARRIER
                       Causes the carrier to be check on AMLC lines; data is
                       only sent out when the carrier is equal to the value
                       given.  It has two forms:

                          -CHECK_CARRIER HIGH
                          -CHECK_CARRIER LOW

           -EVFU       Enables the EVFU (Electronic Vertical Format Unit).

           -PAUSE_EJECT
                       Causes a terminal device to pause between pages until a
                       character is typed.  It has two forms:

                          -PAUSE_EJECT
                          -PAUSE_EJECT RING

                       In the second form, the bell is rung after each page.

        The following keywords are recognized by L3$X2700 and are explained
        in the Xerox 2700-II Driver Manual:

           -HEX
           -FONT
           -LANGUAGE
           -MARGIN
           -SPACE
           -TRAY


        12.4.4  Additional scheduling keywords
+               ______________________________

        In addition to the keywords listed above, a device may be given any
        system-defined or site-defined scheduling keywords.  For convenience,
        the default form and device destination are set up by CDD.


        12.4.4.1  Device default FORM type
+                 ________________________

        All devices have a default FORM type that will be assumed whenever
        devices are started or initialized by the operator.  When a DEVICE is
        created, CDD will insert a reference to this form type:

           -USING PRINTMASTER*>LIBRARY>form_type


        12.4.4.2  The destination
+                 _______________

        The destination of the device is the value of the -AT keyword, and is
        similiar to Prime's -AT option.  When a DEVICE is created, a list of
        destinations for the device may be entered, and the device will print
        any jobs with a matching destination.  It has the form:

           -AT destination1 destination2 destination3 ...

        12.5  DC - Device Command
+             ___________________

        This command allows operators to control devices and has the following
        basic form:

           (1)  DC  device_name  options  commands
           (2)  DC  -HELP

        In the first form, DEVICE_NAME must be a valid device name.  To obtain
        a list of valid device names, type:

           OK, LD PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>@@.CPL

        DC accepts certain options which affect its mode of operation; the
        OPTIONS field may contain any of the following:

           -NW         Sends the command without waiting for a response from
                       the device.

           -ON         Forwards the command to a device on a remote system.
                       It has the form:

                          -ON system_name

                       SYSTEM_NAME must be a valid Primenet system name.

           -START      Tells the monitor to start the device.

        The COMMANDS field of DC may consist of any combination of commands
        recognized by the device.  Each individual command may be accepted or
        rejected.; for each rejected command an error message is printed
        (provided the option -NW is not given).  The commands which a device
        recognizes may be divided into the following groups:


        12.5.1  Commands recognized by all devices
+               __________________________________

        These commands are recognized by all devices.  In general, they affect
        which jobs get scheduled on the device and the device's activity
        between jobs.

           -CONTINUE   Continues the device if it is currently paused between
                       jobs.

           -CONTINUE_EOJ
                       Cancels any pending end-of-job action, such as
                       -STOP_EOJ; continues the device if it is currently
                       paused between jobs.

           -CONTINUE_IDLE
                       Cancels any pending action to be done after the device
                       is idle; continues the device if is currently paused

                       between jobs.

           -EDIT       Edits the device's keyword list with the keywords
                       given.  It has the form:

                          -EDIT edit_keywords

                       EDIT_KEYWORDS must be a non-empty list of editing
                       keywords.  (See EDITING KEYWORD LISTS for a description
                       of editing keywords lists.)

                       The edit operation will not effect the job currently
                       printing.

                       If an error occurs during the edit, the device's
                       keyword list is unchanged.

           -INIT       Resets the device to its initial state (at startup) at
                       the end of the current job.

                       This command will not be accepted if any prior
                       -LOAD_IDLE commands have been given.

                       If accepted, this command clears any prior -LOAD,
                       -LOAD_EOJ, or -INIT_IDLE commands.

           -INIT_EOJ   This is the same as the -INIT command.

           -INIT_IDLE  Resets the device to its initial state (at startup)
                       after it is idle.

                       This command will not be accepted if any prior -LOAD or
                       -LOAD_EOJ commands have been given.

                       If accepted, this command clears any prior -LOAD_IDLE
                       or -INIT_EOJ commands.

           -LIST       Lists the device's keyword list on the terminal.  (See
                       KEYWORD LISTS - TEXT FORMAT for a description of the
                       keyword list format.)

           -LOAD       Edits the device's keyword list with the specified
                       keyword file given at the end of the current job.  It
                       has two forms:

                          (1)  -LOAD pathname
                          (2)  -LOAD filename

                       In the first form, the device will load the keyword
                       file given by PATHNAME.  In the second form, the
                       keyword file FILENAME in the operator's current
                       directory will be used; if this file does not exist,

                       the keyword file in the library on the device's system
                       will be used.

                       The keyword file will be read by the device at the end
                       of the current job, after any prior -INIT, -INIT_EOJ,
                       -LOAD or -LOAD_EOJ commands have been processed.

                       This command will not be accepted if any prior
                       -LOAD_IDLE commands have been given.

           -LOAD_EOJ   This is the same as the -LOAD command.

           -LOAD_IDLE  Edits the device's keyword list with the specified
                       keyword file given after the device is idle.
                       It has two forms:

                          (1)  -LOAD_IDLE pathname
                          (2)  -LOAD_IDLE filename

                       In the first form, the device will load the keyword
                       file given by PATHNAME.  In the second form, the
                       keyword file FILENAME in the operator's current
                       directory will be used; if this file does not exist,
                       the library keyword file will be used.

                       The keyword file will be read by the device when it is
                       idle, after any prior -INIT_IDLE or -LOAD_IDLE commands
                       have been processed.

                       This command will not be accepted if any prior
                       -LOAD_EOJ commands have been given.

           -PAUSE      Pauses the device if it is currently idle.

           -PAUSE_EOJ  Pauses the device at the end of the current job.

                       This cancels a prior -STOP_EOJ command.

           -PAUSE_IDLE Pauses the device when it has been idle for 30 seconds.

                       This cancels a prior -STOP_IDLE command.

           -STATUS     Prints the current status of the device on the
                       terminal.

           -STOP       Stops the device immediately.

           -STOP_EOJ   Stops the device at the end of the current job.

                       This cancels a prior -PAUSE_EOJ command.

           -STOP_IDLE  Stops the device after it is idle.

        12.5.2  Commands recognized by the L2 driver
+               ____________________________________

        These commands are recognized by the line-oriented, Prime compatible,
        level 2 driver (L2).  In general, they only affect the current job and
        are sometimes necessary to successfully complete a job.  Unless
        otherwise noted, all references to a job or the current job refer to
        the COPY of the job currently printing; any other copies are
        unaffected.

           -ABORT      Aborts the current job.  It has the following forms:

                          (1)  -ABORT
                          (2)  -ABORT n

                       In the first form, the job will be aborted immediately.

                       In the second form, N must be greater than zero, and
                       the job will be aborted after N pages.

                       The job is left in the queue and will be restarted from
                       the beginning later (see the L2 driver command -SUSPEND
                       before using this command).

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -ADVANCE    Advances the print file.  It has the form:

                          -ADVANCE n

                       N must be greater than zero.  The device will advance N
                       printed pages.  If there are less than N pages left in
                       the job, the device prints an error message (on the
                       printer) and restarts the current page.

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -ALIGN      Tells the device to enter ALIGN mode.  It has the
                       form:

                          -ALIGN n

                       N must be greater than zero.  The device will be in
                       ALIGN mode for the next N pages of the current job, or
                       the next job if none is currently printing.



        Version 5.4                                                  Page   61

                       When a device enters ALIGN mode, the current page is
                       set to the alignment page.  If the device goes off-line
                       and then back on-line, the rest of that page will be
                       printed and then the device will backup to the
                       alignment page.  This will continue until N pages are
                       printed without interruption or another level 2
                       command is given (such as -CONTINUE).

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command
                       before ALIGN mode is entered.

                       This command will be accepted when the device is idle,
                       and will cause the next job to be started in ALIGN
                       mode.

           -BACKUP     Backs up the print file.  It has the form:

                          -BACKUP n

                       N must be greater than zero.  The device will backup N
                       printed pages.

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -CONTINUE   Clears ALIGN mode; cancels a prior -ABORT, -DROP_COPY,
                       -DROP_JOB, -PAUSE, -SUSPEND command; continues printing
                       if the current job is paused.

           -DROP_COPY  Drops the copy of the job currently printing on the
                       device.  It has the following forms:

                          (1)  -DROP_COPY
                          (2)  -DROP_COPY n

                       In the first form, the copy is dropped immediately.

                       In the second form, N must be greater than zero, and
                       the copy is dropped after N pages.

                       The copy is deleted from the queue,and if it is the
                       last copy, the job is deleted.

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -DROP_JOB   Drops all copies of the job currently printing on the
                       device.  It has the following forms:

                          (1)  -DROP_JOB
                          (2)  -DROP_JOB n

                       In the first form, the job is dropped immediately.

                       In the second form, N must be greater than zero, and
                       the job is dropped after N pages.

                       This causes an implicit -DROP_COPY command to be issued
                       to all other devices printing copies of the job.  The
                       job is deleted from the queue.

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -PAUSE      Pauses the current job.  It has the following forms:

                          -PAUSE
                          -PAUSE n

                       In the first form, the job is paused immediately.

                       In the second form, N must be greater than zero, and
                       the job is paused after N pages.

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command
                       before the device pauses.  If a currently paused
                       device is given -PAUSE 10, it will continue, print
                       10 pages, and then pause again; the operator is not
                       required to continue the device first.

                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -POSITION   Positions the print file to an absolute page number or
                       relative to the current page.  It has the following
                       forms:

                          (1)  -POSITION n
                          (2)  -POSITION +n
                          (3)  -POSITION -n

                       In all forms, N must be greater than zero.  In the
                       first form (absolute), the device will position to the
                       Nth printed page in the job.  In the second form, the
                       device will advance N printed pages from the current
                       page; this is equivalent to the L2 driver command
                       -ADVANCE.  In the third form, the device will backup N
                       printed pages from the current page; this is equivalent
                       to the L2 driver command -BACKUP.

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -RESTART    Restarts the job from the beginning.  A new banner page
                       will be printed.

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -STATUS     Prints the status of the L2 driver on the terminal.

           -STOP       Stops the current job.  It has the following forms:

                          (1)  -STOP
                          (2)  -STOP n

                       In the first form, the job is stopped immediately.

                       In the second form, N must be greater than zero, and
                       the job is stopped after N pages.

                       When a job is stopped, it will be suspended if the job
                       is suspendable, otherwise it will be aborted.  (See the
                       L2 driver commands -SUSPEND and -ABORT.)

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

           -SUSPEND    Suspends the current job.  It has the following forms:

                          (1)  -SUSPEND
                          (2)  -SUSPEND n

                       In the first form, the job will be suspended at the
                       bottom of the current page.

                       In the second form, N must be greater than zero, and
                       the job will be suspend after N pages.

                       A job can only be suspended if it has the keyword
                       -SUSPENDABLE in its keyword list.  Otherwise the
                       command will be rejected by the device.

                       The job will resume later with the page printing when
                       it was suspended.

                       This command causes an implicit -CONTINUE command.
                       This command will not be accepted if the device is not
                       printing.

+             _______________________


        13.1.1  Adding a print job
+               __________________

        To add a print job to the queue, use the APJ command.  This is
        followed by the pathname of the file to print, and options to
        describe how the job should be printed.  The simplest form is:

             OK, apj myfile
             [Add Print Job 2.0]
             Job 0 MYFILE added to queue SYS.
             OK,

        Many options can be included after the filename.  The most common are:

            -FORM ABC                     print the file on form type ABC

            -COPIES 25                    print 25 copies of the file
            -CP 25

            -FTN                          column one in the file is a
                                          carriage-control character; this is
                                          not used with NO_FORMAT

            -AT FLOOR3                    prints the file on a specific printe
        r

            -NO_FORMAT                    print file without any pagination or
            -NF                           carriage-control; this is not used
                                          with FTN

        Examples:

           OK, apj jlh>login.cpl -form white
           [Add Print Job 2.0]
           Job 1 LOGIN.CPL added to queue SYS.
           OK,

           OK, apj jlh>login.cpl -form white -hold
           [Add Print Job 2.0]
           Job 2 LOGIN.CPL added to queue SYS.
           OK,

           OK, apj jlh>login.cpl -form white -defer 22:00
           [Add Print Job 2.0]
           Job 3 LOGIN.CPL added to queue SYS.
           OK,

           OK, apj jlh>login.cpl -form white -no_wait
           [Add Print Job 2.0]
           Job 4 LOGIN.CPL added to queue SYS.
           OK,

        To print another copy of a job queued by another user, type:

           OK, apj pathname -form type -copyfile

        Where PATHNAME is the pathname printed on the banner page and TYPE is
        the form type requested by the user.


        13.1.2  Listing the print queue
+               _______________________

        Use the LPQ command to monitor print queues.  This command lists all
        jobs in the queue with some of their characteristics.  For example:

 OK, lpq
 [List Print Queue 2.0]

 Jobs in queue SYS:

  User  Job         Job name          Pri  Size  Form  Copy status    At     O
 pt
 ------ --- ------------------------- ---  ---- ------ ----------- --------- -

 JIMMY    0 MYFILE                      5     1 STOCK    1/   /
          1 LOGIN.CPL                   5     1 WHITE    1/   /
          2 LOGIN.CPL                   5     1 WHITE    1/   /

  o

 Copy status: copies left/printing/completed.
 Opt (options): Deferred, Hold, print while Open.
 5 jobs in queue.
 OK,

        Under the "Copy status" heading are three fields, describing the
        number of copies left to print (includes copies printing), the number
        of copies printing, and the number of copies completed.


        To list all print queues, including those on remote systems, type:

           OK, lpq -all






        Page   66                                                  Version 5.4

                                                               Quick Reference



        13.1.3  Deleting a job
+               ______________

        Use the DPJ command to delete a print job.  The job number printed by
        APJ and LPQ is used to delete the job, for example:

            OK, dpj 0
            [Delete Print Job 2.0]
            Job 0 MYFILE deleted from queue SYS.
            OK,

        Up to 10 jobs can be deleted with one DPJ command by using a list of
        job numbers:

           OK, dpj 0 1 2 3
           [Delete Print Job 2.0]
           Job 0 MYFILE deleted from queue SYS.
           Job 1 LOGIN.CPL deleted from queue SYS.
           Job 2 LOGIN.CPL deleted from queue SYS.
           Job 3 LOGIN.CPL deleted from queue SYS.
           OK,

        If a job has already started printing, it will stop immediately after
        it is deleted with DPJ.

        Be careful when using this command since operators may delete other
        users' jobs.


        13.1.4  Changing a job
+               ______________

        Use the CPJ command to change certain characteristics of a print job,
        such as the priority or the form type.  Up to 10 jobs can be changed
        with one CPJ command.  The job number printed by APJ and LPQ is used
        to change the job, for example:


 OK, lpq
 [List Print Queue 2.0]

 Jobs in queue SYS:

  User  Job         Job name          Pri  Size  Form  Copy status    At     O

        13.2  Manipulating devices
+             ____________________

        PrintMaster devices are controlled with the DC command.  It has the
        basic form:

           DC  device  commands

        A brief explanation of the most commonly used commands is given below
        (for further information see DC - Device Command).


        13.2.1  Starting a device
+               _________________

        To start a PrintMaster device, use the DC -START command, for
        example:

           OK, dc pr2 -start
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK, stat us

           User                              No  Line Devices
           SYSTEM                             1   asr <PRGDEV> <SYS>
           JIMMY                             68   102 <PRGDEV> <SYS> (3)
           JIMMY                             70   104 <PRGDEV> <SYS> (3)
           JIMMY                             98 phant <PRGDEV> (3)
           BATCH_SERVICE                    101 phant <SYS> (3)
           PR2                              104 phant <SYS> PR2
           PRINTMASTER_MONITOR              105 phant <SYS>
           OK,

        Notice that the user-id of the device phantom is the same as the name
        given in the start command.


        13.2.2  Checking the status of a device
+               _______________________________

        To check the status of a device, use the DC -STATUS command.  For
        example, when the device is idle:

           OK, dc pr2 -status
           [Device Command 2.0]

           Status of device PR2:
             Driver software is version 2.0
             Device is currently idle.
           OK,

        When the device is printing:

           OK, dc pr2 -status
           [Device Command 2.0]




        Version 5.4                                                  Page   69

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



           Status of device PR2:
             Driver software is version 2.0
             Device is currently printing job 1 in queue SYS
             Job name is OPR.INFO
             Pathname is <PRGDEV>PROJ>DOC>OPR.INFO
             Page 11 (disk record 8 of 10) is printing.
             Estimate 2 pages left in job (13 total)
             Total elapsed print time is 1 minute
             Estimate 1 minute to finish (at 10 pages/min)
           OK,


        13.2.3  Stopping a device
+               _________________

        To stop a device immediately, use the DC -STOP command:

           OK, dc pr2 -stop
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,

        To stop a device after the current job, type:

           OK, dc pr2 -stop_eoj
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,

        To stop a device after it completes all jobs in the queue, type:

           OK, dc pr2 -stop_idle
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,


        13.2.4  Changing the device's form type
+               _______________________________

        To change the form type, use the DC -LOAD command, for example:

           OK, dc pr2 -load white
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,

        To change the form type back to the device's default form type:

           OK, dc pr2 -init
           [Device Command 2.0]
           OK,

        13.2.5  List of commands
+               ________________

        This is a list of all commands currently recognized by devices.
        Commands with a star (*) accept either of the optional suffixes _EOJ
        or _IDLE, for example:

        *  -PAUSE                  Pauses the device immediately, after the
                                   current job (-PAUSE_EOJ), or when the
                                   device is idle (-PAUSE_IDLE).

        Some commands accept an optional argument listed in brackets, for
        example:

           -PAUSE [n]              Pauses the device immediately or after N
                                   pages.

        For commands with an optional argument and optional suffixes, only one
        may be used.  For example:

        *  -PAUSE [n]              Pauses the device immediately, after N
                                   pages, after the current job, or when the
                                   device is idle.



           -ABORT [n]              Aborts the current job.
           -ADVANCE n              Advances the print file N pages.
           -ALIGN n                Enters ALIGN mode for N pages.
           -BACKUP n               Backs up the print file N pages.
        *  -CONTINUE               Continues the device if paused.
           -DROP_COPY [n]          Cancels the copy currently printing.
           -DROP_JOB [n]           Cancels all copies of the job currently
                                   printing.
           -EDIT edit_keywords     Edits the device's keyword list.
        *  -INIT                   Resets the device to its default keyword li
        st.
           -LIST                   Prints the device's keyword list.
        *  -LOAD form_type         Changes the device's form type.
           -NW                     Sends command without waiting for reply
                                   from device.
           -ON system              Forwards command to device on remote
                                   system.

        13.3  Form types
+             __________

        PrintMaster form types allow form attributes such as characters per
        line, fonts and margins to be specified with the -FORM option.

        13.3.1  Creating form types
+               ___________________

        The command used to create form types is CFD.  It will ask you for the
        name of the form, its synonyms, characters per line, and lines per
        page.

        A form name must be a valid filename and less than 30 characters.  If
        users have form types which are not valid filenames, they should be
        made synonyms.  For example:

           -FORM STOCK ' '
           -FORM NARROW_STOCK '8 X 11'
           -FORM FOUR_PART_STOCK 4PRT

        This is similar to the PROP environment options PAPER and FORM.

        It is important that the number of lines per page is correct, or the
        job accounting data will be wrong.


        13.3.2  Listing form types
+               __________________

        To list the form type STOCK, type:

           OK, ekf stock -lib -list
           [Edit Keyword File 2.0]
              -FORM STOCK
              ' '
              -CHARS_PER_LINE 80
              -LINES_PER_PAGE 66

        14  SYSTEM FILES AND DIRECTORIES
+           ____________________________

        There are two main directories needed to run PrintMaster.  The first,
        PRINTMASTER*, is called the system directory.  It contains programs,
        system keyword files, and command files used by PrintMaster.  The
        second, PRINTMASTER_QUEUE*, is the PrintMaster print queue directory.
        It contains all files needed for queueing jobs, including job keyword
        lists and print files copied to the queue.  There can be many queues
        per system, but only one system directory.  However, each system in
        the network will have its own system directory.


        14.1  The System Directory PRINTMASTER*
+             _________________________________

        This directory contains all of the PrintMaster system information:

            BANNER_LETTERS         - this file has the 5 by 7 large letters
                                     printed on the banner page.  It can be
                                     replaced or modified if a site wants to
                                     customize banner letters

            COMO (dir)             - device and monitor como files

            DEVICES (dir)          - driver CPL programs, keyword files, and
                                     timed-out keyword files

            EPF_LIBRARIES (dir)    - contains PrintMaster EPF libraries; this
                                     must be accessible to all users

            LIBRARY (dir)          - this is the keyword file library; when
                                     -USE XYZ is used, PrintMaster will look
                                     in this directory for the keyword file
                                     XYZ.KF if it doesn't exist in the current
                                     directory

            MASTER.KF              - this is the master keyword file

            PHASE-II               - if this file exists, Phase II has been
                                     installed

            PRINTMASTER.ENTRY$.SR  - search rules for PrintMaster

            PROGRAMS (dir)         - RUN files and infrequently used CPL
                                     programs

            PROJECT_DEFAULTS (dir) - project default keyword files

            SYSTEM_DEFAULTS.KF     - these are the system job defaults that
                                     are inserted in every job queued

            USER_DEFAULTS (dir)    - user default keyword files

        14.2  PrintMaster Queue Directories
+             _____________________________

        PrintMaster queue directories are named PRINTMASTER_QUEUE*.  There
        are four segment directories in this queue to store job keyword
        lists, print files, etc.  The queue is verified when it is read by
        the monitor to make sure all read/write locks are correct, and to
        delete any inconsistent queue entries.  Normally, users do not have
        L access to queues.  This is a security feature - since users will
        not know the names of the files in the queue, they cannot read or
        modify anything in the queue.  It is necessary for all users to have
        RW access to files in the queue to add and delete jobs.  If queue
        security is a major concern, don't use the -COPYFILE option when
        queueing jobs.

                                                             Advanced Features



        15  ADVANCED FEATURES
+           _________________

        Some of the more sophisticated features in PrintMaster, such as
        user-written device drivers and applications of keyword matching, are
        described in this section.


        15.1  User-Written Device Drivers
+             ___________________________

        The PrintMaster device driver program is broken into three levels.
        Level 1 is called the system level.  It performs functions such as
        opening print files and reading the job keyword list, and any others
        that must be done for all jobs.  The source for this level will not
        be released, as customers should not have to modify it.  The level 2
        driver reads the print file and interprets its contents.  Currently,
        only one level 2 driver, L2$MAIN, is available.  It is intended to
        simulate the features found in the Prime spooler, such as line number
        and no-format modes.  PrintMaster was designed to allow this level to
        be replaced, but it may be quite difficult, since L2$MAIN is around
        1500 lines of PL/I.  Level 3 drivers are the device interface
        procedures. These were designed to be as simple as possible.  The
        current drivers range from 100 to 200 lines of PL/I.  Customers may
        add or change level 3 drivers as needed without modifying,
        recompiling, or reloading the standard PrintMaster software


        15.2  Paper Usage Accounting
+             ______________________

        The PrintMaster device driver program maintains statistical
        information about jobs (e.g. total pages printed, form type, user id,
        etc.) that may be passed to a paper usage accounting procedure upon
        completion.  Like the level 3 drivers, this was designed to be as
        simple as possible.  The supplied accounting procedure,
        L2$ACCOUNTING, consists of approximately 150 lines of straightforward
        PL/I.  Customers may add other procedures or change this one as
        needed.  The accounting procedure is specified with the -ACCOUNTING
        keyword, which is in the keyword file
        PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>DEVICE_DEFAULTS.KF.


        15.2.1  The Supplied Accounting Procedure, L2$ACCOUNTING
+               ________________________________________________

        This procedure allows paper usage accounting to be performed on a
        per-job basis; the presence of the -ACCOUNTING keyword in a job's
        keyword list enables accounting.

        The accounting file, PRINTMASTER*>ACCOUNTING.DATA, is a standard
        Primos text file with a record length of 552 characters.  Since much
        of this is blank and the file is compressed, each record doesn't
        actually need 552 characters.  Around 16 accounting records fit in
        one disk record, depending on the length of user-id's, etc.  When
        accounting is enabled on a job, a record is written after each copy



        Version 5.4                                                  Page   75

        finishes, even if it is aborted or dropped.  Before processing the
        accounting file, its name should be changed to prevent holding up a
        device while the file is open.  The accounting record format is:


                  Accounting Field                            Type      Length

                                                           Routine Maintenance



        16  ROUTINE MAINTENANCE
+           ___________________

        There are several maintenance procedures the System Administrator
        may periodically need.  Most are used when either the Prime system
        configuration is changed, or the defaults created when PrintMaster
        was originally installed need to be modified.


        16.1  Creating and Moving Print Queues
+             ________________________________

        Print queues may have to be created if disk space is scarce on the
        current print queue partition, or if another partition is better
        suited for a print queue.  The CPQ (Create Print Queue) command is
        used to make new queues.  It will ask for the partition where the new
        queue is to be created.  You must have ALL access to the MFD on this
        partition.  Queues are directories called PRINTMASTER_QUEUE*.  If
        necessary, queues can be copied with the Primos COPY command to
        another partition.  Always shutdown all devices and the monitor
        before attempting this.  The -CA option must be used with the COPY
        command to copy the queue file attributes.  The queue may contain
        jobs when it is moved.


        16.2  Deleting Print Queues
+             _____________________

        Print queues can be deleted with the Primos DELETE command.  Devices
        and the monitor do not have to be shutdown, but there cannot be any
        activity in the queue (such as jobs printing), or the delete will
        fail and the queue will be destroyed.  Attach to the MFD where the
        queue is located, and DELETE PRINTMASTER_QUEUE*.


        16.3  Changing the System Job Defaults
+             ________________________________

        When PrintMaster is initially configured, the job defaults are
        entered, and stored in PRINTMASTER*>SYSTEM_DEFAULTS.KF.  These may
        need to be changed periodically.  The file can be edited with the
        keyword file editor EKF, or the dialog used to set defaults when
        PrintMaster was configured can be used.  To use EKF, attach to the
        system directory (PRINTMASTER*), and use the -EDIT or -CREATE and
        -LIST options to modify the keyword file.  For example, to change the
        default destination to PR0, use the commands:

            OK, a printmaster*
            OK, ekf system_defaults -edit -at pr0
            [Edit Keyword File 2.0]
            OK,

        To use the question and answer method, attach to
        PRINTMASTER*>PROGRAMS and run SET_SYSTEM_DEFAULTS.  This CPL program
        will prompt for all input needed to change the defaults, and is the
        same one used by the configuration program CONFIGURE_PRINTMASTER.

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        16.4  Changing Device Defaults
+             ________________________

        Some device characteristics, such as whether devices restart after a
        coldstart, are kept in the device default keyword file
        PRINTMASTER*>DEVICES>DEVICE_DEFAULTS.KF.  All devices have these
        characteristics, and all will change if this file is changed.  To
        change defaults, use the EKF command to edit the keyword file, or run
        the CPL program SET_DEVICE_DEFAULTS.CPL in PRINTMASTER*>PROGRAMS.
        This program will ask a series of questions to modify device
        defaults.


        16.5  Modifying Devices
+             _________________

        Devices are usually created or changed by the System Operator, and
        complete information on this is in the DEVICES section of this
        manual.   The program used is CDD - Create Device Def.  It will ask
        you for all of the device's characteristics.


        16.6  Modifying Form Types
+             ____________________

        Form types are usually created or changed by the System Operator, and
        complete information on this is in the FORM DESCRIPTION FILES
        section.  The program used is CFD, Create Form Def.  It will prompt
        for form characteristics for the form.


        16.7  Modifying the System List
+             _________________________

        The system list is a text file, SYSTEM_LIST, in PRINTMASTER*.  It is
        only used for networks, and has all systems in the network sharing
        resources listed from high to low priority.  The job scheduler runs
        on the highest active system.  All systems in a system list must have
        identical SYSTEM_LIST files.  They can be changed with a text editor,
        such as ED, or with the CPL program CREATE_SYSTEM_LIST.CPL in
        PRINTMASTER*>PROGRAMS.

        IMPORTANT:  All systems in the system list must be changed before
                    any monitors are restarted, since a monitor will
                    abort if its system list is different from the others.

                                                          Removing PrintMaster



        17  REMOVING PRINTMASTER
+           ____________________

        The CPL program REMOVE_PRINTMASTER.CPL program in
        PRINTMASTER*>PROGRAMS is used to delete Printmaster from the system.
        It has several options, to allow partial or complete removal.


        17.1  Reinstalling the Prime Spooler
+             ______________________________

        If Phase 2 has been installed (Prime SPOOL and PROP commands have
        been replaced), this program can be used to go back to Phase 1, where
        the Prime spooler and PrintMaster are operating concurrently.   The
        PrintMaster CPL emulation programs are removed and the original Prime
        SPOOL and PROP programs are reinstated.  If users are logged in when
        phase 2 is removed, they will have to issue the ICE or SSR -DFLT
        ENTRY$ commands to get new search rules.


        17.2  Removing PrintMaster Commands and Help Files
+             ____________________________________________

        PrintMaster commands and help files are also removed with
        REMOVE_PRINTMASTER to "clean up" the command and help directories.
        This can only be done if phase 2 has been removed, or was never
        installed, and should only be done after the PrintMaster queues
        are empty and no devices are running.


        17.3  Removing Queues and the System Directory
+             ________________________________________

        The PrintMaster system directory and print queues are never deleted
        by REMOVE_PRINTMASTER, and must be deleted using the Primos DELETE
        command from the MFD.  PrintMaster commands should be removed before
        this, and no PrintMaster devices or monitors should be running.

        IMPORTANT: When the system directory is deleted, all form and
+       _________
        paper types are deleted, along with all defaults created with the
        configuration program.

        18.1  Troubleshooting
+             _______________


        This section is a troubleshooting guide for PrintMaster.  If a problem
        cannot be solved by reading this section, please report it via the
        phone number listed in the documentation packet.

        Six problems are discussed here:

            1)  Monitor won't start
            2)  Monitor shuts down after it is started
            3)  A device won't start
            4)  A device shuts down after it is started
            5)  A device won't respond to device commands
            6)  There are jobs in the queue, but they won't print


        18.1.1  Monitor Won't Start
+               ___________________


        1)  Is PRINTMASTER* ACL'ed correctly?
            Attach to PRINTMASTER* and do an LAC command.  The ACL should be:

                 ACL protecting "<Current directory>":
                         SYSTEM:                 DALURW
                         .PRINTMASTER_OPERATOR:  ALL
                         .PRINTMASTER_SYSTEM:    ALL
                         $REST:                  LUR

        2)  Does your login program have checks for valid user-id's in it?
            If so, the user-id PRINTMASTER_MONITOR must be added to your login
            program.  The symptom of this problem is that the COMO file
            PRINTMASTER*>COMO>PRINTMASTER_MONITOR.COMO does not get created
            before the monitor aborts.

        18.1.2  Monitor Goes Down After Starting
+               ________________________________


        1)  Check PRINTMASTER*>COMO>PRINTMASTER_MONITOR.COMO for additional
            information on why the monitor crashed.

        2)  If the system partition (partition with PRINTMASTER*) was
            shutdown, logout all active devices and run INIT_PRINTMASTER.CPL
            again from the console.

        3)  Are all SYSTEM_LIST files on all systems identical? (networks
            only)  Any mismatched system lists received from remote systems
            will cause the monitor to crash.  Mismatched lists are written out
            with an ascending serial number (SYSTEM_LIST.1, SYSTEM_LIST.2,
            etc.) in PRINTMASTER*.

        4)  Is the local system name in the system list? (networks only)

        5)  Are only valid system names in the system list? (networks only)


        18.1.3  Device Won't Start
+               __________________


        1)  Check PRINTMASTER*>COMO>XXX.COMO where XXX is the device's
            name for more information.

        2)  Were all required keywords present with valid values?

        3)  Was the device specified with ASSIGN_DEVICE already in use?

        4)  Is the monitor up?

        5)  Try logging out the monitor and running INIT_PRINTMASTER.

        6)  Does your login program have checks for valid user-id's in it?
            If so, a user-id will have to be created for each device since
            PrintMaster devices have user-id's which match their device name.


        18.1.4  Device Goes Down
+               ________________


        1)  Check PRINTMASTER*>COMO>XXX.COMO where XXX is the device's
            name for more information.

        2)  If the device was not started by the monitor, does it have access
            to PRINTMASTER* and PRINTMASTER_QUEUE* ?

        3)  Was the device shutdown normally (possibly from a remote system)?

        4)  If -TIME_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN was used on this device, it may just be

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



            timed-out.  Try doing a DC XXX -STATUS command where XXX is the
            device's name.  If the device responds "ready", it was timed-out.


        18.1.5  Device Won't Respond to Commands
+               ________________________________


        1)  Check PRINTMASTER*>COMO>XXX.COMO where XXX is the device's
            name for more information.

        2)  Is the device started (and command is not -START)?

        3)  If the device is trying to print a job, is it turned on?

        4)  If -ON was used with DC, is the remote system available?

        5)  If -ON was used with DC, is the remote system's monitor up?

        6)  If -ON was used with DC, is the local monitor up?


        18.1.6  Jobs Won't Print
+               ________________


        1)  Is there a device available that the job matches?
            Use DC XXX -LIST to view the device's keyword list where XXX is
            the device's name, and LPJ N to view job N's keyword list.

        2)  Is the job still open?  If so, it must be closed before it will
            print.

        3)  If -COPYFILE was not used, does the file still exist, and does
            the device have read access rights to it?  A priority ACL
            .PRINTMASTER_SYSTEM:ALL should be on the file's partition.

        4)  Two semaphores are used by Printmaster, as specified in the CPL
            program INIT_PRINTMASTER.CPL.  Are these being used by any other
            software?  This cannot be detected, but will cause PrintMaster to
            function incorrectly.

        5)  Is the monitor up?  Devices will not print jobs unless the monitor
            is running.

        6)  Is the job deferred?

        7)  Is the job's partition accessible to the device?  This is more of
            a concern in network environments where all disks are not visible
            on all systems.

        8)  Is the job larger than the maximum the device will print (as
            specified in the device keyword -JOB_SIZE_LIMIT)?




        Page   82                                                  Version 5.4

        9)  If nothing else works, log out all devices and the monitor and run
            INIT_PRINTMASTER again from the system console.  Devices will have
            to be restarted with DC.

        This list is not complete, and will be updated as problems occur and
        are diagnosed.  Again, call if the problem cannot be resolved.


        18.2  Updates & Revisions
+             ___________________

        PrintMaster update tapes will be sent periodically, to fix problems
        and introduce enhancements.  The file UPDATES_v, where "v" is the
        version number, will be kept in PRINTMASTER>INFO>UPDATES.  This will
        describe all changes made in this version.  Scheduled enhancements
        are listed in the next section.  Every effort will be made to make
        future revisions compatible with existing versions.

        PrintMaster System Administrator's Guide



        19  FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
+           ___________________

        Many enhancements are scheduled for PrintMaster including new
        features and support for more device types.


        19.1  List Queue Keyword Selection
+             ____________________________

        Enhancements to LPQ will include the ability to select which job
        keywords will be printed.  This feature will make use of the keyword
        list matching facility, so that a typical LPQ command may be:

            OK, lpq -select_jobs -user fred -form stock -select_kws -job_name

        This command would select all jobs with -USER FRED and -FORM STOCK.
        From these jobs selected, only the -JOB_NAME keyword would be
        printed.


        19.2  Block Oriented Devices
+             ______________________

        There is only one level 2 device driver for PrintMaster today.  It
        simulates the actions of the Prime spooler, more or less.  It expects
        the file to be a text file with lines shorter than 500 characters.
        This format is fine for line printers, but does not work for plotters
        and other devices which are NOT line oriented.  A "block I/O" driver
        is being written to handle these devices.  This will support both
        parallel and serial RS-232 plotters, and user-written low-level
        device drivers may be written for these, just as for line oriented
        devices.
