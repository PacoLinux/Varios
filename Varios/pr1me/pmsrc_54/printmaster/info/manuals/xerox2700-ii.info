        1  Overview
+          ________

        This document describes the PrintMaster interface to the Xerox 2700
        Model 2 Distributed Electronic Printer.  The printer is a laser
        imaging system that supports multiple font types, character sets,
        languages, and page layouts.  All of these features are accessible
        through job and devices keywords in PrintMaster:


            o    -FONT allows user/device selection of fonts.  Both font
                 cartridges and dynamic (downloadable) fonts are supported.
                 Downloading is done on demand.  Landscape or portrait
                 orientation and font id's are also selected with this
                 keyword.

            o    -MARGIN sets page dimensions.

            o    -LANGUAGE specifies the character set to be used.

            o    -ESCAPE allows alternate definitions of the code used to
                 initiate special functions.

            o    -SPACE sets interline spacing to 1/2, full space, 1 1/2
                 space, double space or triple space.

            o    -MERGE allows "boilerplating" for letterheads, etc.

            o    -HEX causes files to be dumped in hex format, a feature of
                 the Xerox 2700-II.

            o    -TRAY selects paper source tray (top, bottom, either).

        PrintMaster Xerox 2700-II Driver



        2  Device Configuration
+          ____________________

        The  PrintMaster 2700 driver supports both the parallel and serial
        interface.  If the serial interface is used, the device should be
        configured with 8-bit ASCII, no parity, XON/XOFF data flow control,
        and any line speed.  Because the 2700 sends XOFF when its buffer has
        only 64 characters left, the AMLC DMQ buffer size may have to be set
        at less than 100 (octal) or the line speed may have to be limited.  A
        print buffer can be put to good use with the 2700 in the serial
        configuration.  The line-ending should be set to CR-LF or LF only, to
        allow overstriking by sending a carriage return without a linefeed.
        Any default margins, font, and language can be configured.  It will
        be necessary to use the device keyword -PARITY FLIP with the serial
        interface to flip all parity bits, since Prime ASCII normally has the
        parity bit on; this will also allow accessing ISO characters if
        parity bits are NOT set on characters. Special ISO characters cannot
        be accessed through the parallel interface unless a foreign language
        is selected.

        When configuring the PrintMaster device, the device driver name is
        L3$X2700.  Any keywords specifying font information, etc. can be
        specified when the device is created, or added later.

        3  Font Selection and Loading
+          __________________________

        The 2700 supports internal, cartridge, and dynamic font types.  There
        are two internal fonts, XCP14-L and Titan10iso-P, having landscape
        and portrait orientation, respectively.  These are available at all
        times.  Plug-in ROM cartridge fonts are supported by PrintMaster and
        are treated just like internal fonts.  Dynamic fonts reside in the
        Primos file system and are downloaded to the 2700 when requested by a
        job.  The PrintMaster 2700 driver also assigns font ID's to all fonts
        requested by a job.  Font ids are single digits that allow users to
        specify font changes in the print file using ESCn, where n is a font
        id digit 0-9.


        3.1  Device Keyword -FONTDEF
+            _______________________

        This keyword is used to define known fonts.  It allows abbreviations
        font names, and font locations to be specified.  All fonts do not
        have to be included in the FONTDEF keyword, but it will make life
        easier for the user if most are.  The FONTDEF keyword format is:

            -FONTDEF
               font1
               font2
                ...
               fontn

        Each value describes a single font and contains up to four
        10-character abbreviations, an equal sign, the actual Xerox font name
        (in upper and lower case characters), a colon, and the font location.
        No blanks should be used as separators.  The font location is a
        pathname, blank, or the value "ROM".  If a pathname is specified, the
        font is downloaded from the file system when required.  If ROM is
        used, the font is either one of the two internal fonts or a cartridge
        font.  If no location is given, all font libraries (specified with
        the -FONTLIB keyword below) will be searched for the font.  If it is
        not found, the font is assumed to be a cartridge.

        Examples:

            -FONTDEF
                 Kosmos10-L
                 LG,LGP=LetterGothic12-P:FONTS>LETTERGOTHIC12.FONT
                 V=Vintage10-L:ROM
                 P,PORT,PORTRAIT=Titan10iso-P:ROM
                 L,LAND,LANDSCAPE=XCP14-L

        This FONTDEF defines 5 fonts.  Whenever a font is requested by a
        user, the 2700 driver will look for the font in the FONTDEF, without
        regard to case.  If found, the font name in the FONTDEF overrides the
        name the user gave, e.g., if a user specifies font KOSMOS10-L, the
        name sent to the device will be Kosmos10-L.  This is important since



        Version 5.4                                                  Page    3

        PrintMaster Xerox 2700-II Driver



        font names are case sensitive on the 2700.  The second value
        describes the font LetterGothic12-P.  There are two abbreviations, LG
        and LGP.  Users can use LG, LGP, lg, lgp, LetterGothic12-P, or
        LETTERGOTHIC12-P to identify this font.  It is a dynamic font, and
        should be downloaded from the file FONTS>LETTERGOTHIC12.FONT.  If
        this file is inaccessible, the device will logout to prevent printing
        the job incorrectly.  The third value describes a cartridge font,
        VINTAGE10-L, and lists one abbreviation.  The last two values
        describe the internal fonts and gives them three appropriate
        abbreviations.  Note that the location has been accidently omitted on
        the last font; the device will search all libraries for XCP12-L, and
        assume it is a cartridge or internal font if not found.

        Example:

            -FONTLIB
               <DSKA>MFD>FONTS
               <7>HP_FONTS
               XEROX_FONTS




        3.2  Device Keyword -FONTLIB
+            _______________________

        This lists all directories where dynamic fonts may be found.  These
        are searched when a font is requested that was not defined with
        FONTDEF.  Font files have the same name as the font they contain.  If
        any directories are inaccessible when an undefined dynamic font is
        requested, the device will logout to prevent printing a job
        incorrectly.  The operator can either hold the job causing the error,
        modify the device by removing the bad library, or wait until the
        library is available.



        3.3  User/Device Keyword -FONT
+            _________________________

        This describes fonts required by a job, or default font assignments
        on a device.  Each value describes a single font.  The first font
        listed will be the initial font used to print the job.  Font ID's are
        also assigned with this keyword.  Values can have 3 different forms:

            digit                 - used to specify internal font 0 or 1
                                    as the default font without listing its
                                    name

            name                  - abbreviation or actual font name - the
                                    next sequential font ID will be assigned

            digit:name            - font ID and the corresponding
                                    abbreviation or actual font name



        Page    4                                                  Version 5.4



1







        If no font ID's are used, ID's will be assigned sequentially
        beginning with ID 2, since 0 and 1 are assigned to the two internal
        fonts.  If more than 8 fonts are listed, numbering cycles from ID 9
        to ID 0.  A maximum of 10 font ID's can be assigned.



        Examples:


            -FONT KOSMOS10-L 'Elite12-P'

                 The font KOSMOS10-L is assigned font ID 2 (assuming the
                 FONTDEF above was used).  Font Elite12-P is assigned id 3.
                 Quotes were required for the second font but not the first,
                 because the Elite font was not defined with FONTDEF.  The job
                 will begin printing in the Kosmos10-L font.


            -FONT 1 3:v LG

                 Font 1 will be the initial font (it's internal), font 2 is
                 not assigned, font 3 will be Vintage10-P, and font 4 will be
                 LetterGothic12-P.  If the LetterGothic12-P font had not been
                 previously downloaded, this job will cause it to be
                 downloaded and all other dynamic fonts cleared from the
                 2700.  Subsequent jobs using this font will not cause any
                 downloading unless they use other dynamic fonts.

        When this keyword is used with a device, it specifies the fonts that
        should be available and their font ID assigments if the user does not
        specify font information.  It may be a good idea to specify the most
        commonly used dynamic fonts to prevent excessive downloading.

        4  Other Job or Device Keywords
+          ____________________________

        These keywords activate special features on the 2700, and can be used
        with either jobs or devices.  When used with a device, the keyword
        specifies a default value that can be overridden by the job.


        4.1  -ESCAPE x

                 Creates an alternate definition for the escape character used
                 to activate electronic printing options.  The default
                 character is the ASCII code ESC.  This character may have to
                 be quoted to prevent it from being interpreted by the Primos
                 command line handlers.


        4.2  -HEX

                 Requests the 2700 to dump data in hexadecimal.  If used on a
                 device, all control sequences sent by the device driver will
                 be printed in hex (font downloads, etc.).  If used on a job,
                 only the job's data will be printed in hex.


        4.3  -JOB_COMMENT comment

                 Specifies a comment up to 130 characters to be printed on the
                 job status sheet.  The comment will have to be quoted if it
                 contains special characters, such as spaces.  If no comment
                 is given, the default will be used, e.g.:

                 Job 10 PGMA.SPL queued to SYSDSK by user JIMMY in project PRO
        G


        4.4  -LANGUAGE x

                 Sets the language according to values in the 2700 manual,
                 e.g., 0 is American English, 1 is UK English, etc.

        4.5  -MARGIN s t b l r

                 Defines paper size, top, bottom, left and right margins.
                 Each value can be specified in either inches or 60ths of an
                 inch.  If a value is less than 15, inches are assumed.
                 Fractional values such as 1.75 can be used.

                 NOTE: the right margin is the distance from the LEFT edge of
                       the page, as stated in the Xerox manual.

                 EXAMPLE:  To print a standard 66 line page on 8 1/2 x 11
                           paper, use something like -MARGIN 11 16 16 .25 8.5


        4.6  -MERGE pathname

                 Specifies page merging.  If a pathname is used with this
                 keyword, it specifies the Primos file to be downloaded as the
                 constant page.  This file is downloaded line by line, without
                 any formatting considerations, i.e., FTN carriage control,
                 etc.  If the -MERGE keyword is used with the job, merging
                 will be enabled by the driver before the job begins
                 printing.  If -MERGE is used only on the device, the constant
                 page is loaded, but is not enabled by default; the job must
                 enable merging with the esc-z-e command.


        4.7  -SPACE n

                 Specifies interline spacing.  Possible values of n are .5, 1,
                 1.5, 2, and 3.  Any other values will cause single spacing.


        4.8  -TRAY n

                 Selects paper tray.  0=both,  1=top,  2=bottom
                 Selection remains in effect until the next job unless the
                 device also has the -TRAY keyword.

        4.9  Special Considerations
+            ______________________

        There are a few areas where unusual problems can occur with the 2700
        device and/or driver.

            1. The device is reset between jobs with the ESC+X command, so all
               margin settings, font id assignments, etc. revert back to the
               setting on the 2700 hardware, unless overridden with device or
               job keywords such as -MARGIN, -FONT, etc.

            2. Because the reset command causes the output stacker to reset to
               the initial position, the driver software must keep track of
               when an offset is needed.  If the driver is logged out, it
               forgets whether an offset is needed for the next job, and
               assumes one is not.  If the last job was stacked in the initial
               position, the next job (after the device is started) will be
               placed in the same stack.  We suggest that the operator empty
               the output stacker whenever the driver goes down, and that the
               "automatic shutdown after idle" feature not be used with the
               2700.

            3. The driver software keeps track of which dynamic fonts are
               currently loaded in the 2700.  If the driver goes down, all
               dynamic fonts requested by the next job after the driver is
               restarted will be downloaded (even though this may be
               unnecessary) - this is not a problem.  However, if the 2700 is
               powered down and the driver remains logged in, all dynamic
               fonts are lost but the driver software has no way of knowing
               this.  Therefore if the 2700 is powered down, the driver should
               be stopped and restarted.  This also applies to constant page
               data (-MERGE).

            4. Trailing blanks are never stripped from print lines (nor are
               they ever added).  If justification is being used, be careful
               about trailing blanks on lines.

            5. Skipping to channels other than 1 (top of form) is not
               supported and will cause a job error - the job is dropped.

            6. If a constant page file is not accessible, the device shuts
               down to prevent printing the job incorrectly.  The operator
               must correct or delete the job.
