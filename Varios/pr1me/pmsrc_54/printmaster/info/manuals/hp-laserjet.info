        1  Overview
+          ________

        This document describes the PrintMaster interface to the HP LaserJet
        Level III Electronic Printer.  The printer is a laser imaging system
        that supports multiple font types and page layouts.  These LaserJet
        features are accessible through job and devices keywords in
        PrintMaster:

            o    -FONT allows user/device selection of fonts.

            o    -MARGIN sets page dimensions.

            o    -LINES_PER_INCH sets vertical line spacing

        2  Device Configuration
+          ____________________

        The device should be configured with 8-bit ASCII and XON/XOFF data
        flow control.

        Use the keyword -PARITY on the device with a value of FLIP to flip all
        parity bits.

        When configuring the PrintMaster device, the device driver name is
        L3$LASERJET.  Keywords specifying font information, etc. can be
        specified when the device is created, or added later.

        3  Font Selection and Loading
+          __________________________

        The LaserJet supports internal and cartridge fonts.  Fonts consist of
        a series of eight font characteristics.  The LaserJet allows two fonts
        to be active at a given time, designated the primary and secondary
        fonts.  The PrintMaster device driver supports these and provides an
        easy-to-use user interface.  When a device is created, font
        characteristics may be given names with -FONTDEF and referenced by
        users with -FONT when jobs are queued.


        3.1  Device Keyword -FONTDEF
+            _______________________

        This keyword is used to name fonts.  It allows the system
        administrator to assign names to LaserJet fonts.  A font must be
        defined before it can be referenced by users in their jobs.  The
        FONTDEF keyword format is:

            -FONTDEF
               font-1
               font-2
                ...
               font-n

        Each value, FONT-1 through FONT-N, defines a single font and may
        contain up to four 10-character names separated by commas, an equal
        sign, and the eight LaserJet font characteristics separated by commas.
        The characteristics are:  orientation, symbol set, spacing, pitch,
        point size, style, stroke weight, and typeface, respectively.  For
        example, here is a -FONTDEF that defines three fonts:

            -FONTDEF
               standard,portrait,sp,p=0,8U,0,10,12,0,0,3
               landscape,l=1,8U,0,10,12,0,0,3
               italic-p=0,8U,0,10,12,1,0,3

        The first font has four names:  STANDARD, PORTRAIT, SP, and P.  It
        designates a font with the following properties:

             Characteristic    Value    Meaning
+            ______________    _____    _______
                orientation      0      Portrait
                 symbol set     8U      Roman-8
                    spacing      0      Fixed Spacing
                      pitch     10      10 Chars/Inch
                      point     12      12 Point Char Height
                      style      0      Upright Style
                     weight      0      Medium Weight
                   typeface      3      Courier Typeface

        The values for each of these characteristics are not checked for
        validity by the LaserJet driver; they are passed to the printer with
        the necessary escape sequences.  See the LaserJet manual, pages 4-9
        to 4-19, for a list of possible values for each characteristic.



        3.2  User/Device Keyword -FONT
+            _________________________

        This describes fonts required by a job, or default font assignments
        on a device.  Each value designates a single font and must be the
        name of a defined font (see -FONTDEF).  Either one or two fonts may be
        requested; the first font will be the primary font and the second will
        be the secondary font.  If the above -FONTDEF had been given, the
        following examples would be valid:

            -FONT STANDARD ITALIC-P
            -FONT SP ITALIC-P
            -FONT L

        Note that the second example specifies the same fonts as the first,
        since "SP" is another name for "STANDARD".

        If two fonts are specified that have different orientations, the
        orientation of the primary font will be used for both.  (This is a
        restriction of the printer.)

        When -FONT is used with a device, it specifies the default fonts that
        should be set up if the user does not specify font information.

        4  Other Job or Device Keywords
+          ____________________________

        These keywords activate special features on the LaserJet, and can be
        used with either jobs or devices.


        4.1  -LINES_PER_INCH lpi

                 Specifies the vertical spacing.  If a value is given with
                 this keyword, the vertical spacing will be set to LPI; LPI
                 may be a fractional value.


        4.2  -MARGIN pl tm xl lm rm

                 Defines paper length, top margin, text length, left and right
                 margins.  Each value is given in inches.  Fractional values
                 such as 1.75 can be used.

                 If no values are given, then 11, 0.5, 10.5, 0, and 8.5 inches
                 are assumed.

                 When this keyword is used with a device, it specifies the
                 default margins to be used if the user does not specify
                 margin information.

                 NOTE: the right margin is the distance from the LEFT edge of
                       the page.  The character position for line truncation
                       or wrapping will be calculated based on the left and
                       right margins and the pitch of the primary font; this
                       will override the value of the -CHARS_PER_LINE keyword.
                       If no fonts have been specified, 10 pitch will be
                       assumed.

                 If -MARGIN and -LINES_PER_INCH are used together, the lines
                 per page setting (-LINES_PER_PAGE lpp) will be ignored;
                 (LPI * XL) lines will appear in the text region.  If -MARGIN
                 is used and -LINES_PER_INCH is omitted or has no value, the
                 vertical line spacing will be adjusted so that the number of
                 lines per page requested will fit in the text region.
                 For example:

                     -LINES_PER_INCH 6
                     -LINES_PER_PAGE 66
                     -MARGIN 11 0.5 10.5 0 8.5

                 would cause 63 lines (6 lines/inch * 10.5 inches) to be
                 printed at 6 lines per inch in the text region (and the lines
                 per page setting would be ignored).  Whereas, either:

                     -LINES_PER_PAGE 66
                     -MARGIN 11 0.5 10.5 0 8.5

                 or:

                     -LINES_PER_INCH
                     -LINES_PER_PAGE 66
                     -MARGIN 11 0.5 10.5 0 8.5

                 would cause 66 lines to be printed at 6.2857 lines per inch
                 (66 lines / 10.5 inches) in the text region.  (This latter
                 form allows users to override any default lines per inch
                 setting the device may have.)

        5  Special Considerations
+          ______________________

        There are a few areas where unusual problems can occur with the
        LaserJet device and/or driver.

            1. The device is reset between jobs with the (ESC)E command, so
               all margin settings and fonts revert back to the setting on the
               LaserJet hardware, unless overridden with device or job
               keywords such as -MARGIN, -FONT, etc.

            2. When the LaserJet receives a set of font characteristics, it
               selects the internal font which is the best approximation for
               the characteristics given.  It also ignores any characteristic
               with an invalid value.  (See the LaserJet manual for a
               description of this process.)  The LaserJet device driver has
               no way of knowing which internal font will be selected and
               which characteristics will be ignored by the LaserJet.
