.dn  {{Overview}}
This document describes the PrintMaster interface to the Xerox 2700
Model 2 Distributed Electronic Printer.  The printer is a laser
imaging system that supports multiple font types, character sets,
languages, and page layouts.  All of these features are accessible
through job and devices keywords in PrintMaster:


    o    -FONT allows user/device selection of fonts.  Both font
         cartridges and dynamic (downloadable) fonts are supported.
         Downloading is done on demand.  Landscape or portrait
         orientation and font id's are also selected with this
         keyword.

    o    -MARGIN sets page dimensions.

    o    -LANGUAGE specifies the character set to be used.

    o    -ESCAPE allows alternate definitions of the code used to
         initiate special functions.

    o    -SPACE sets interline spacing to 1/2, full space, 1 1/2
         space, double space or triple space.

    o    -MERGE allows "boilerplating" for letterheads, etc.

    o    -HEX causes files to be dumped in hex format, a feature of
         the Xerox 2700-II.

    o    -TRAY selects paper source tray (top, bottom, either).

.dn  {{Device Configuration}}
The  PrintMaster 2700 driver supports both the parallel and serial
interface.  If the serial interface is used, the device should be
configured with 8-bit ASCII, no parity, XON/XOFF data flow control,
and any line speed.  Because the 2700 sends XOFF when its buffer has
only 64 characters left, the AMLC DMQ buffer size may have to be set
at less than 100 (octal) or the line speed may have to be limited.  A
print buffer can be put to good use with the 2700 in the serial
configuration.  The line-ending should be set to CR-LF or LF only, to
allow overstriking by sending a carriage return without a linefeed.
Any default margins, font, and language can be configured.  It will
be necessary to use the device keyword -PARITY FLIP with the serial
interface to flip all parity bits, since Prime ASCII normally has the
parity bit on; this will also allow accessing ISO characters if
parity bits are NOT set on characters. Special ISO characters cannot
be accessed through the parallel interface unless a foreign language
is selected.

When configuring the PrintMaster device, the device driver name is
L3$X2700.  Any keywords specifying font information, etc. can be
specified when the device is created, or added later.
.dn  {{Font Selection and Loading}}
The 2700 supports internal, cartridge, and dynamic font types.  There
are two internal fonts, XCP14-L and Titan10iso-P, having landscape
and portrait orientation, respectively.  These are available at all
times.  Plug-in ROM cartridge fonts are supported by PrintMaster and
are treated just like internal fonts.  Dynamic fonts reside in the
Primos file system and are downloaded to the 2700 when requested by a
job.  The PrintMaster 2700 driver also assigns font ID's to all fonts
requested by a job.  Font ids are single digits that allow users to
specify font changes in the print file using ESCn, where n is a font
id digit 0-9.
.dd  {{Device Keyword -FONTDEF}}
This keyword is used to define known fonts.  It allows abbreviations
font names, and font locations to be specified.  All fonts do not
have to be included in the FONTDEF keyword, but it will make life
easier for the user if most are.  The FONTDEF keyword format is:

    -FONTDEF
       font1
       font2
        ...
       fontn

Each value describes a single font and contains up to four
10-character abbreviations, an equal sign, the actual Xerox font name
(in upper and lower case characters), a colon, and the font location.
No blanks should be used as separators.  The font location is a
pathname, blank, or the value "ROM".  If a pathname is specified, the
font is downloaded from the file system when required.  If ROM is
used, the font is either one of the two internal fonts or a cartridge
font.  If no location is given, all font libraries (specified with
the -FONTLIB keyword below) will be searched for the font.  If it is
not found, the font is assumed to be a cartridge.

Examples:

    -FONTDEF
         Kosmos10-L
         LG,LGP=LetterGothic12-P:FONTS>LETTERGOTHIC12.FONT
         V=Vintage10-L:ROM
         P,PORT,PORTRAIT=Titan10iso-P:ROM
         L,LAND,LANDSCAPE=XCP14-L

This FONTDEF defines 5 fonts.  Whenever a font is requested by a
user, the 2700 driver will look for the font in the FONTDEF, without
regard to case.  If found, the font name in the FONTDEF overrides the
name the user gave, e.g., if a user specifies font KOSMOS10-L, the
name sent to the device will be Kosmos10-L.  This is important since
font names are case sensitive on the 2700.  The second value
describes the font LetterGothic12-P.  There are two abbreviations, LG
and LGP.  Users can use LG, LGP, lg, lgp, LetterGothic12-P, or
LETTERGOTHIC12-P to identify this font.  It is a dynamic font, and
should be downloaded from the file FONTS>LETTERGOTHIC12.FONT.  If
this file is inaccessible, the device will logout to prevent printing
the job incorrectly.  The third value describes a cartridge font,
VINTAGE10-L, and lists one abbreviation.  The last two values
describe the internal fonts and gives them three appropriate
abbreviations.  Note that the location has been accidently omitted on
the last font; the device will search all libraries for XCP12-L, and
assume it is a cartridge or internal font if not found.

Example:

    -FONTLIB
       <DSKA>MFD>FONTS
       <7>HP_FONTS
       XEROX_FONTS


.dn  {{Device Keyword -FONTLIB}}
This lists all directories where dynamic fonts may be found.  These
are searched when a font is requested that was not defined with
FONTDEF.  Font files have the same name as the font they contain.  If
any directories are inaccessible when an undefined dynamic font is
requested, the device will logout to prevent printing a job
incorrectly.  The operator can either hold the job causing the error,
modify the device by removing the bad library, or wait until the
library is available.

.dn  {{User/Device Keyword -FONT}}
This describes fonts required by a job, or default font assignments
on a device.  Each value describes a single font.  The first font
listed will be the initial font used to print the job.  Font ID's are
also assigned with this keyword.  Values can have 3 different forms:

    digit                 - used to specify internal font 0 or 1
                            as the default font without listing its
                            name

    name                  - abbreviation or actual font name - the
                            next sequential font ID will be assigned

    digit:name            - font ID and the corresponding
                            abbreviation or actual font name

If no font ID's are used, ID's will be assigned sequentially
beginning with ID 2, since 0 and 1 are assigned to the two internal
fonts.  If more than 8 fonts are listed, numbering cycles from ID 9
to ID 0.  A maximum of 10 font ID's can be assigned.



Examples:


    -FONT KOSMOS10-L 'Elite12-P'

         The font KOSMOS10-L is assigned font ID 2 (assuming the
         FONTDEF above was used).  Font Elite12-P is assigned id 3.
         Quotes were required for the second font but not the first,
         because the Elite font was not defined with FONTDEF.  The job
         will begin printing in the Kosmos10-L font.


    -FONT 1 3:v LG

         Font 1 will be the initial font (it's internal), font 2 is
         not assigned, font 3 will be Vintage10-P, and font 4 will be
         LetterGothic12-P.  If the LetterGothic12-P font had not been
         previously downloaded, this job will cause it to be
         downloaded and all other dynamic fonts cleared from the
         2700.  Subsequent jobs using this font will not cause any
         downloading unless they use other dynamic fonts.

When this keyword is used with a device, it specifies the fonts that
should be available and their font ID assigments if the user does not
specify font information.  It may be a good idea to specify the most
commonly used dynamic fonts to prevent excessive downloading.
.du

.dn  {{Other Job or Device Keywords}}
These keywords activate special features on the 2700, and can be used
with either jobs or devices.  When used with a device, the keyword
specifies a default value that can be overridden by the job.
.dd  -ESCAPE x
         Creates an alternate definition for the escape character used
         to activate electronic printing options.  The default
         character is the ASCII code ESC.  This character may have to
         be quoted to prevent it from being interpreted by the Primos
         command line handlers.
.dn  -HEX
         Requests the 2700 to dump data in hexadecimal.  If used on a
         device, all control sequences sent by the device driver will
         be printed in hex (font downloads, etc.).  If used on a job,
         only the job's data will be printed in hex.
.dn  -JOB_COMMENT comment
         Specifies a comment up to 130 characters to be printed on the
         job status sheet.  The comment will have to be quoted if it
         contains special characters, such as spaces.  If no comment
         is given, the default will be used, e.g.:

         Job 10 PGMA.SPL queued to SYSDSK by user JIMMY in project PROG
.dn  -LANGUAGE x
         Sets the language according to values in the 2700 manual,
         e.g., 0 is American English, 1 is UK English, etc.
.dn  -MARGIN s t b l r
         Defines paper size, top, bottom, left and right margins.
         Each value can be specified in either inches or 60ths of an
         inch.  If a value is less than 15, inches are assumed.
         Fractional values such as 1.75 can be used.

         NOTE: the right margin is the distance from the LEFT edge of
               the page, as stated in the Xerox manual.

         EXAMPLE:  To print a standard 66 line page on 8 1/2 x 11
                   paper, use something like -MARGIN 11 16 16 .25 8.5
.dn  -MERGE pathname
         Specifies page merging.  If a pathname is used with this
         keyword, it specifies the Primos file to be downloaded as the
         constant page.  This file is downloaded line by line, without
         any formatting considerations, i.e., FTN carriage control,
         etc.  If the -MERGE keyword is used with the job, merging
         will be enabled by the driver before the job begins
         printing.  If -MERGE is used only on the device, the constant
         page is loaded, but is not enabled by default; the job must
         enable merging with the esc-z-e command.
.dn  -SPACE n
         Specifies interline spacing.  Possible values of n are .5, 1,
         1.5, 2, and 3.  Any other values will cause single spacing.
.dn  -TRAY n
         Selects paper tray.  0=both,  1=top,  2=bottom
         Selection remains in effect until the next job unless the
         device also has the -TRAY keyword.

.dn  {{Special Considerations}}
There are a few areas where unusual problems can occur with the 2700
device and/or driver.

    1. The device is reset between jobs with the ESC+X command, so all
       margin settings, font id assignments, etc. revert back to the
       setting on the 2700 hardware, unless overridden with device or
       job keywords such as -MARGIN, -FONT, etc.

    2. Because the reset command causes the output stacker to reset to
       the initial position, the driver software must keep track of
       when an offset is needed.  If the driver is logged out, it
       forgets whether an offset is needed for the next job, and
       assumes one is not.  If the last job was stacked in the initial
       position, the next job (after the device is started) will be
       placed in the same stack.  We suggest that the operator empty
       the output stacker whenever the driver goes down, and that the
       "automatic shutdown after idle" feature not be used with the
       2700.

    3. The driver software keeps track of which dynamic fonts are
       currently loaded in the 2700.  If the driver goes down, all
       dynamic fonts requested by the next job after the driver is
       restarted will be downloaded (even though this may be
       unnecessary) - this is not a problem.  However, if the 2700 is
       powered down and the driver remains logged in, all dynamic
       fonts are lost but the driver software has no way of knowing
       this.  Therefore if the 2700 is powered down, the driver should
       be stopped and restarted.  This also applies to constant page
       data (-MERGE).

    4. Trailing blanks are never stripped from print lines (nor are
       they ever added).  If justification is being used, be careful
       about trailing blanks on lines.

    5. Skipping to channels other than 1 (top of form) is not
       supported and will cause a job error - the job is dropped.

    6. If a constant page file is not accessible, the device shuts
       down to prevent printing the job incorrectly.  The operator
       must correct or delete the job.
