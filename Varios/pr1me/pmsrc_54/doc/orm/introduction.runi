.dn  {{Introduction}}
This document is an operator reference manual for PrintMaster, a set
of programs designed to replace the Prime SPOOL system.  It describes
PrintMaster, in detail, from the point of view of an operator.  Some
familiarity with Prime's SPOOL system is assumed.

All PrintMaster commands accept the option -HELP; this will give a
brief description of how to use the command.  Additional help is
available via Prime's HELP command.
