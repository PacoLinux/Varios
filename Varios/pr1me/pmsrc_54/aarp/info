Tom -

Here's the edit subroutine to remove -NO_WAIT whenever user DC queues
a job.  If the user name is wrong or you need it to do something else,
give me a call.  There is one MAGSAV tape on this reel.  MAGRST will
create a new ufd AARP wherever you're attached before the restore.


To install this:

    1.  Copy AARP>AARP$JOB_EDIT.RUN to PRINTMASTER*>EPF_LIBRARIES

    2.  Edit your search rules in SYSTEM>ENTRY$.SR
        Look for the line -USE PRINTMASTER*>...
        After this, insert the line:
              PRINTMASTER*>EPF_LIBRARIES>AARP$JOB_EDIT.RUN
        File it

    3.  Add a keyword to your system defaults keyword file:

              A PRINTMASTER*
              EKF SYSTEM_DEFAULTS -JOB_EDIT AARP$JOB_EDIT


That's it.  Currently logged in users will have to logout, do an ICE
command, or SSR -DFLT ENTRY$ before they will notice any difference.
There shouldn't be any problem doing this while users are on.  Call
if you have problems.



                                               Jim


P.S.   To rebuild this, move the directory AARP to PRINTMASTER>REBUILD
       This is only necessary if you change the routine.
