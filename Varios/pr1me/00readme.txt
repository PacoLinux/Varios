I ran across some Prime PLP and SPL projects of mine from the early 80's that might be of interest to those who have never seen PL/I code or systems-level code in PL/I.
"dutil" is a disk utility I wrote when I was 19 and a OS specialist at Prime's Detroit office. It is a utility to examine a disk using sector read and writes and allows things like fixing damaged directories, record headers, etc.
"pmsrc_54" is a network spooler a friend and I wrote together. When print jobs are submitted, they get routed to the least-busy printer, which may be on another system.
"pbhist" is a Prime-supplied tool to monitor a program's execution and report on where it is spending most of its time. This was done by sampling the program's runtime program counter.
Enjoy!
