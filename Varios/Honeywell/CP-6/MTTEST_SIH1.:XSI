     Primarily, MTTEST is intended to weed out physically bad tapes, supply a
quick confidence check of tape drive capability, give the C.E. a
tool that will access a tape drive in a predictable manner, and
furnish a tool that can be used to check tape drive compatibility.
     Secondary, in its submode of editing routine, records/files
can be selectively copied from input tape to output tape or display
their contents.
 
.*B*
       To run MTTEST, type !MTTEST.X at the IBEX level.
       MTTEST will then prompt with a dollar ('$') for a command.
       There are eight basic commands,
 
1)  M[OUNT] LT#tsn
2)  W[RITE] LT#tsn [(output_options)]
3)  R[EAD] LT#tsn [(input_options)]
4)  T[EST] LT#tsn [(output_options)]
5)  REW[IND] LT#tsn
6)  REM[ove] LT#tsn
7)  ED[IT] LT#tsn1 [ 'ON| TO| OVER' LT#tsn2 ]
    7.1) S[KIP] [I/O_option] [Rec/File_option] [display_option]
    7.2) C[OPY] [Rec/File_option] [Copy_option]
    7.3) D[ISPLAY] [I/O_option] [Rec/File_option] [display_option]
    7.4) REW[IND] [I/O_option]
    7.5) END, QUIT, EXIT, X to return back to primary TEST mode.
7)  E[ND]
8)  Q[UIT]

.*K* COMMANDS FUNCTION
.*B*   MOUNT M
       MOUNTING TAPE
 
M[OUNT] Request specified tape be mounted and report its density & type.
 
.*B*   WRITE W
       WRITING TAPE
 
W[rite] requests MTTEST to perform output only operations on some
        magnetic tape as controlled by the lack of, or existence of
        one or more options. Options remain in effect until next
        command changes them explicitly.
 
LT#tsn is used to describe the tape serial number to be called for on
       any drive with the specified density.
 
output_options is a list separated by "," of one or more of the following.
(Density | Block | Pattern | Repetition | Nrec | STOP);
 
D[ENSITY]={1600[BPI] | 6250[BPI] | 800[BPI]} requests MTTEST to use
          that specific density in all of its tape mount requests.  If
          not specified, then whatever the system defaults to, and the
          operator mounts will be used.
 
B[lock]=nnK[words]/nnnnB[ytes] requests MTTEST to write N[rec] blocks
           at the same size of n Kwords or n bytes. The available
           blocks are n bytes or 1k,2k,4k,6k,8k,10k,...,62k.
 
P[attern]={ON[es] | Z[eroes] | OD[d] | E[ven]
                  | C[heckerboard] | S[equential] | .}
          requests MTTEST to use a specific pattern in all of its blocks.
 
E[ven] requests a repeating bit pattern of 01.
 
OD[d] requests a repeating bit pattern of 10.
 
ON[es] requests a repeating bit pattern of 11.
 
Z[eroes] requests a repeating bit pattern of 00.
 
C[heckerboard] requests a repeating pattern of 524526522532.
 
S[equential], sequences all the patterns and write each one from BOT to EOT.
 
R[epetition]=nn requests MTTEST to cycle the tape the number
             of times specified, with 01 being the default.  A cycle
             means one pass from BOT to EOT.
 
N[rec] stop after N(up to 9999) records has been read/written, specify N=0 to
       read from BOT to EOT.
 
 STOP =RETRY request rewind and stop R/W operation when hardware
             retry happend. STOP=ERROR will log the retries and stop
             only when I/O error happend.
 
 LOG = RETRY report locations of records which need retry, and number
             of retries performed each time. LOG = NO gives no report.
 
.*B* READ R
       READING TAPE
 
R[ead] requests MTTEST to perform input only operations as controlled
       by the existence or non existence of the following options.
 
input_options are a list, separated by "," of one or more of the following;
 
(Density | Repetition | Nrec | STOP | LOG )
 
.*B* TEST T
    TESTING TAPE
 
T[est] requests MTTEST to combine the W[rite] and R[ead] functions
       during the same pass.  This requires use of M$PRECORD to move
       the tape backwards before reading the record.  Most options are
       as for W[rite].  B[lock], if unspecified defaults to 4K[words],
 
.*B* EDIT ED
    ED[it] LT#tsn1[(density)] [ 'ON/TO/OVER' LT#tsn2[(density)] ]
 
ED[it] request MTTEST to go in its submode of tape editing routine.
       There are 4 major submode commands which are REWIND, SKIP,
       COPY, DISPLAY with option separate by blank.
density spec is the same as in TEST mode.
     tsn1, tsn2 are input and output tape serial number respectively.
 
.*B* REWIND REW
    REW[ind] [I/O_option]
 
REW[ind] request MTTEST submode to rewind tapes.
 
I/O_option are Input, Output or Both. Default to input tape.
     Tape serial number may also be used for rewind.
 
.*B* SKIP S
    S[kip] [I/O_option] [Rec/File_option] [Display_option]
 
S[kip] request MTTEST submode to move tape forward or backward.
 
Rec/File_option is ( +/- n | ALL ) ( Records | Files )
     -n cause tape move backwards by n records/files, stop after hit
     file mark with no display if records is specified or stop with no
     display when hits BOT if file is specified. Skip all files is
     implemented as skip 1 file to keep it from running off reel
     easily. Default to 1 record.
 
display_option is Display ( m | ALL ) [( BYte=j-k| BYte=j:k| Recsize=
     k| AScii| BInary )]
     m or all records are displayed for each file if file is specified
     for Rec/File_option.
     BYte=j-k dsiplay byte j to byte k for each record. Default to
              full record.
     BYte=j:k dsiplay byte j follow by k bytes for each record.
     Recsize=k is the same as BYte=0-k.
     BInary read tape in BINARY. If not specified, default to read in
       ASCII.
     AScii display tape contents read in ASCII. Default to display
      in this option.
     OCTal display in octal with ASCII translation.
 
.*B* COPY C
    C[OPY] [Rec/File_option] [ copy_option ]
 
C[opy] request MTTEST submode to copy records/files from input tape
     to output tape.
copy_options are ( DEOD| ERR=Stop/Continue| BYte=n-m/n:m| display
    _option )
     DEOD is double end of data mark implemented as double file mark.
     ERR on I/O may ignored during read operation, not for write tape.
     copy byte n to byte m orbyte n follow by m bytes for each record
     , default to full record.
 
.*B* DISPLAY D
    D[isplay] [I/O_option] [ Rec/file_option ] [display & back option]
 
D[isplay] request MTTEST submode to display tape contents in ASCII or
     binary format with ASCII translation, Back_option if selected
     will back to its orignated place after display operation.
 
 
.*B* DEFAULT
       INTERNAL SPECIFICATIONS
 
1) There will be a set of %EQUATES for each option and command.
 
2) The commands will be abreviated to the smallest unique character set.
 
3) The basic defaults are
 
    D[ensity] = 0   ( lets the system decide )
 
    B[lock] = 4K[words]
 
    P[attern] = C[heckerboard]
 
    R[epetitions] = 1
