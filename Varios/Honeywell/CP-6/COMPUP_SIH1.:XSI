COMPUP compares two files of updates and tells you if they are
mutually exclusive, i.e. if one can be copied into the other without
clobbering the other's updates.  COMPUP works on a key-by-key basis,
so use KEYUP first for non-keyed update files.  Use COMPUP as follows:
 
     !COMPUP.X   one_pluscard_file,other_pluscard_file ON,listing_output(opt)
 
The "other_pluscard_file" needn't have a name if it is the same.
The output from COMPUP lists the update records side-by-side.  In the
"margin" between the records is an indicator of whether or not the
records are "safe"...won't clobber the other's records.  If the
margin indicator is an equal sign (=), then the records match.
A dash (-) separator indicates equality but only in the first 1024 bytes.
If the margin indicator is a tilde (~) then the record is the same
key as the other file, but different contents.  If the margin
indicator is an or-bar (|), this indicates that this is a non-destructive
difference between the two files.  If opt is present, it may contain any
combination of the separator characters (~, =, -, |) and requests that COMPUP
suppress those output lines.  COMPUP will finish by printing a one-
line summary describing if it's okay to merge the two update files via a
command like !COPY .... INTO  .....
Note that COMPUP doesn't look at the pluscards, so it won't detect
overlapping updates.  Also, consecutive files are formatted so that
you can see where the updates would go (and/or what they would replace).
 
COMPUP is handy for finding out if two people's update files are mutually
compatible.
