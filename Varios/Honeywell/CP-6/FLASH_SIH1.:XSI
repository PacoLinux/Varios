FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
FLASH (Friendly LCP6/ASYNC Stats Harvester) reads a listing from Stats's "Di
Fep X" command and produces a datafile containing one record per snapshot.  It
is assumed that the input listing contains more than one snapshot; this is not,
however, strictly necessary.  Currently, only the LCP6 and Async stats are
munged; all other handlers are ignored.
.*B*
Command line syntax for FLASH is:
 
      !FLASH.X  inputfid  [ ON | OVER | TO ] outputfid
 
For more information, see the following topics in this Help file:
 
 
      !HELP (FLASH.X) INPUT_FMT        "How to generate the input file
      !HELP (FLASH.X) OUTPUT_FMT       "What the output file looks like
.*K* INPUT_FMT INPUT_FORMATS
FLASH expects to look at the complete output listing from Stats's "Di Fep X"
command.  The listing may be captured by setting M$LO to a file.  For long-term
Stats gathering, it is most efficient to log the info in a file, and then
produce the listing later via the Replay commmand.  Type ? for examples . . .
.*B* EXAMPLE1
The following JCL fragments illustrate how to generate a Stats listing for
FLASH:
 
      !Set M$LO *Listing
      !Stats
         Int 5          "Set the interval; may be anything Stats will take
         Di Fep X 3     "Select a Fep to grab stats for
         Go 144         "grab 144 snapshots (12 hours worth)
         End
      !Reset M$LO
      !FLASH.X *Listing over *Datafile
 
Type ? for an example using Replay
.*B* EXAMPLE2
 
      !Stats "in a ghost job somewhere
         File STATS:FEP3_870219
         Log Fep 3
         Int 5
         Go 144
         End
      !"
      .
      .
      !Set M$LO *Listing
      !Stats
         File STATS:FEP3_870219
         Di Fep X 3
         Replay
         End
      !Reset M$LO
