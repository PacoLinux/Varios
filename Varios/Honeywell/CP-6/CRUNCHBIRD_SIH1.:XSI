CRUNCHBIRD is a program which may be used to compact CP-6 mailboxes.
.*R*
CRUNCHBIRD is used as follows:
 
   !CRUNCHBIRD.X fid [ON/TO/OVER outfid] [(option,....)]
 
"fid" identifies the mailbox file that is to be compacted.  CRUNCHBIRD does not
understand MAIL's "/folder" format;  the mailbox must be identified via a
standard CP-6 fid (usually of the form ":MAIL_folder.account".
 
"outfid", if present, specifies that a new, compacted mailbox is to be created,
and that the "fid" mailbox is not to be modified.  If "outfid" is not
specified, the mailbox specified by "fid" is replaced by the new, compacted
mailbox.
 
Acceptable options are "n [DAYS]", and "CRUNCH".
.*R*
CRUNCHBIRD has three basic functions:
 
-  It removes any traces of messages which were not completely deleted by MAIL
(if, for example, a user !QUIT from mail while MAIL was in the process of
deleting a message), and any mailgrams which have been marked as "deleted" but
not yet purged from the mailbox.
 
-  It can delete messages which have been in the mailbox for more than a
specified number of days.
 
-  It can remove certain records from the mailbox which are used by MAIL only
for the "ANSWER RECEIVERS" feature, and which are not used by DABBLE.X at all.

.*K* COMMAND COMMAND_FORMAT FORMAT INVOKATION
CRUNCHBIRD is used as follows:
 
!CRUNCHBIRD.X fid [ON/TO/OVER outfid] [(option,....)]
 
"fid" identifies the mailbox file that is to be compacted.  CRUNCHBIRD does not
understand MAIL's "/folder" format;  the mailbox must be identified via a
standard CP-6 fid (usually of the form ":MAIL_folder.account".
 
"outfid", if present, specifies that a new, compacted mailbox is to be created,
and that the "fid" mailbox is not to be modified.  If "outfid" is not
specified, the mailbox specified by "fid" is replaced by the new, compacted
mailbox.
 
Acceptable options are "n [DAYS]", and "CRUNCH".
 
See !HELP (CRUNCHBIRD.X) OPTIONS for a description of these options.
.*K* OPTIONS
The options behave as follows:
 
"n DAYS" (or simply "n"), where "n" is a decimal integer.  Specifies that any
messages older than "n" days, which have not been flagged via MAIL's "MARK"
command, are to be removed from the mailbox.
 
If this option is not specified, messages are not removed on the basis of their
age.
 
Mailgrams which have been flagged by MAIL as "DELeted" will always be purged,
regardless of their age.
 
CRUNCH - specifies that all records not required for the operation of DABBLE.X
should be purged from the mailbox.  This will include the "FROM", "TO", "C",
"BC", and "REPLY TO" records associated with each mailgram.
 
If this option is not specified, all records (except for those in mailgrams
being purged) will be retained in the mailbox.
 
.*K* NOTES
CRUNCHBIRD may be used with either of the above options, with both, or with
neither.
 
Using CRUNCHBIRD with neither option is an easy way to "clean up" a mailbox and
to rebuild its index structure, thus permitting MAIL and DABBLE to access the
mailbox more efficiently.
 
Using CRUNCHBIRD with the "n DAYS" option, on a regular basis, is a convenient
way of ensuring that the mailbox is not "bogged down" with a large number of
old messages.
 
Using CRUNCHBIRD with the "CRUNCH" option will result in a significant (and
sometimes major) decrease in the size of the mailbox, especially where the
mailbox contains a large number of small messages.  The records removed by the
CRUNCH option are used only for one purpose (MAIL's "Answer Receivers"
command), and are not needed otherwise.
.*B*
Using CRUNCHBIRD with both options is a good way to keep the size of
DABBLE-able mailboxes down to a modest size, without affecting the normal
operation of DABBLE, MAIL, or MAILMAN.
 
CRUNCHBIRD always operates by copying the contents of the existing mailbox to a
new file.  All of the FPARAM information from the old mailbox (access controls,
extent size, file compression, etc.) is retained.
.*K* EXAMPLES
Examples:
 
!CRUNCHBIRD.X :MAIL_BB.:MEETING (90 DAYS, CRUNCH)
 
Compresses the bulletin-board meeting file in :MEETING, by removing all
unnecessary MAIL records and purging any mailgrams older than 90 days (unless
flagged for retention with the MARK command in MAIL).
 
!CRUNCHBIRD.X :MAIL_SF-LOVERS.:MEETING OVER :MAIL_TEST (30)
 
Creates a new mailbox called :MAIL_TEST in the current file management
directory, by copying all mailgrams younger than 30 days from the
science-fiction-fans meeting file.
.*K* STEPCC
CRUNCHBIRD will set a specific STEPCC value when it exits, depending on the
success of the mailbox compaction, as follows:
 
  0     Successful completion
 10     Error parsing options; operation aborted.
 20     Profile record not the first in mailbox; operation aborted.
 30     Encountered an unknown record type in the mailbox; operation
        was completed anyway, with the unknown record(s) copied.
 40     An I/O error of some sort occurred.
