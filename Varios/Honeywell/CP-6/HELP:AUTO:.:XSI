 
AUTO - Alters B$JIT.DEFPRI & B$JIT.MAXPRI
 
     Allows you to raise B$JIT.MAXPRI between the hours of 17:30 and
     05:30 on weekdays, and all day on Saturday and Sunday, so that
     you can batch jobs off at a priority of 8.  After you set your
     B$JIT.MAXPRI to 8 using AUTO, use the IBEX "PRIO" command to
     change the default priority for jobs you batch off.
 
     (Note: AUTO must be copied to, and run from, the :SYS account
     if persons without EXMM or JIT privilege are allowed to use it.)
 
Usage:
     !AUTO (MAXPRI=8)                   "Set maximum priority"
     !PRIO 8                            "Set default priority"
 
     You can also set the default priority (B$JIT.DEFPRI) with AUTO
     by specifying "DEFPRI=n".
 
     Minimum abbreviations are: D/EFPRI & M/AXPRI.
 
Typical usage:
     !AUTO (DEFPRI=8,MAXPRI=8)
 
Recommended usage:
     !AUTO (DEFPRI=6)
     << Batch off your jobs >>
     << Log off >>
     << Go home >>
