APLTOOLS.X is a tool crib of useful functions for APL programmers.
.*B*
The workspace APLTOOLS.X contains utility functions that should be usefull to
many APL programmers.  Functions in this workspace provide the ability to build
and display file access control matrices, file record field definition
matrices, create name lists, read files, translate character data to upper
case, display terminal attributes, display CP6 windows, cross reference APL
programs and display CP6 UTS values as a date and time.

Function         Purpose
 
BUILDNL       This function creates a namelist from a
              character vector.
 
COPYRIGHT     This function adds a copyright notice to every
              function in the workspace.

              names, numbers and attributes of the currently open
              files.  The files opened may be closed or new files
              may be opened by positioning in the form.

              variables and their associated values.  (Usefull in association
              with the PARSE function in this workspace).
 
HELP          This function performs the operation of the CP-6
              help command.  The right argument is a full help
              command minus the opening HELP.

              to modify some of the system variables.
 
TERMATTR      This function returns a character vector indicating
              the current terminal attributes.
 
TEXLIST       This function translates the contents of a file containing APL
              text into a TeX document that will print using APL characters.
 
TRUP          This function translates all lower case characters
              into upper case.
 
UTS           This function returns a character date and time given
              a CP6 UTS value.
 
WINDOWS       This function displays information about each window.

              for a particular string within all of the functions or some of
              the functions in the workspace.

This function is used to produce a formatted display a file's fit.  When
invoked correctly, it prompts for a command which must be a single integer
number (the fit fparam number to be displayed) or on of the following commands:
END, HELP, OCTAL, DOCTAL or NOCTAL.  The END command causes this function to
stop execution.  The OCTAL command causes the entire contents of the file's fit
to be display in octal.  The DOCTAL command causes future fparam portions to be
both formatted and displayed in octal.  Finally, the  NOCTAL command causes
future fparam portions to be only formatted which is the default.
 
If an all blank line is entered, the numbers of the fparams that are in the
current fit are displayed.

.*R*
options    is a simple character vector containing the HELP options (or topics)
that information is being requested.
 
fid        is a simple character vector containing the name of the help file to
default information from if a HELP file is not specified.
 
Description:
 
The options string is parsed and if it contains a help file name then that help
file is opened.  Otherwise, if a help file is not currently open, then the
default help file specified by the left argument is opened.
 
The options string is expected to contain a legal help command without a
leading HELP.  The additional information commands '?' and '??' are also
permitted.
 
The result of this function is that HELP for the specified topic(s) will be
displayed.

This function may be used to create HERMAN.X compatible source input from a
HELP database.  The output of this function may be directed to a file by
setting $Q1 in APL or F$Q1 from IBEX.
 
Example:

.fif
.*R*
      )SET $Q1 *SI,FUN=C,EXIST=NEWF
      HELPSI 'HELP:APLTOOLS:.X'

.*K* WSLOC
WSLOC
 
Syntax:
 
     WSLOC 'string'
.*R*
     'fns' WSLOC 'string'
.*R*
 
Parameters:
 
string     is the character string that is to be located.
 
fns        is an optional namelist containing the names of the functions to be
searched.  If this parameter is not specified, all of the functions in the
active workspace will be searched.
 
Description:
 
This function is used to locate all of the occurances of the specified string
in functions in the active workspace.  For every occurance of the string, the
function name, linenumber and the function line are printed.

.*K* ROSEG
ROSEG
 
Syntax:
 
     ROSEG
 
Description:
 
This niladic function uses the $QPEEK system function to display all of the
allocated DCBs.  The function displays the DCB number, name, assignment and
indication of whether the dcb is open or closed.
 
.*R*
.*K* TEXLIST
TEXLIST
 
Syntax:
 
     'infid' TEXLIST 'outfid'
 
Parameters:
 
infid      is the name of a file containing APL text.
 
outfid     is the name of a file to create containing a TeX source document for
printing the file containing the APL characters.
 
Description:
 
This function reads a file containing APL text and creates a TeX source file
which when formatted will display the contents of the original file in the APL
character set.  The TeX source document requires access to the "apldefs:tex"
file which defines macros for all of the APL characters, and the font apl10 (a
10pt APL font).

.*K* PARSE $QPARSE $QGETCMD
PARSE
 
Syntax:
 
     PARSE NODES
.*R*
     'NODE_NAME' 'EQU_FID' PARSE NODES
.*R*
 
Parameters:
 
NODES      is an integer vector containing PARSE nodes as created by the
LINKNODES function.
 
NODE_NAME  is the optional name of the node at which to parse.
 
EQU_FID    is the name of a file containing PL6 %EQU or %SET directives
defining the node codes to use when displaying the parse nodes; OR the second
item of the left argument may contain the result of the GETEQUS function.
 
RELATED FUNCTIONS: LINKNODES, MAPNODES, GETEQUS
 
Description:
 
This APL function performs the same capabilities as the CP-6 X account run-unit
PARSE.X.  The right argument must be an integer vector parse node variable as
created by the LINKNODES function in this workspace or the LINKNODES.X
workspace.  This function uses the optional left argument to determine the node
at which to parse and also the text to display for node codes.  If no left
argument is present, the parse begins at the first node defined.
 
This function prompts for input and then parses the input according to the
parse nodes provided.  The output of the parser is displayed, one line for each
node produced.
 
This function uses the package PARSEPACK in this workspace.
 
RELATED FUNCTIONS: LINKNODES, MAPNODES, GETEQUS.
 
.*R*
.*K* LINKNODES
LINKNODES
 
Syntax:
 
     NODES_LINKNODES 'fidlist'
 
Parameters:
 
NODES      are parse nodes that may be used by the APL system functions $QPARSE
and $QGETCMD.
 
fidlist    are CP-6 file names separated by commas which are object units
created by the PARTRGE processor.
 
RELATED FUNCTIONS:  PARSE, MAPNODES
 
Description:
 
This function reads the specified files and creates an integer vector parse
node array suitable for the $QPARSE and $QGETCMD system functions.
 
USES:      LINKPACK in APLTOOLS.X
.*R*
RELATED FUNCTIONS:  PARSE, MAPNODES
 
.*R*
.*K* MAPNODES
MAPNODES
 
Syntax:
 
     MAPNODES NODES
 
Parameters:
 
NODES   is an integer vector parse node array created by the LINKNODES function
in this workspace or by the LINKNODES.X workspace.
 
RELATED FUNCTIONS: LINKNODES, PARSE, GETEQUS
 
Description:
 
This function prints the names of the parse nodes that are defined in the
specified parse node array and their location.  The location is suitable for
specifying the parse node offset to the $QPARSE and $QGETCMD system functions.
 
USES:   LINKPACK and PARSEPACK in APLTOOLS.X

RELATED FUNCTIONS: LINKNODES, PARSE, GETEQUS
 
.*R*
.*K* GETEQUS
GETEQUS
 
Syntax:
 
     EQUS_GETEQUS 'fid'
 
Parameters:
 
fid     is the name of a CP-6 file containing simple pre-processor expressions
of the form:
 
.*R*
    %EQU name = value;
.*R*
    %EQU name = name +/- value;
.*R*
 
The result is a 2-item array which contains the names of the variables and
their associated values.  This function is intended to be used by the PARSE
system function to obtain printable names for parse node codes.
