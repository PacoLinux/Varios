DABBLE: Displays A Bulletin Board's Latest Entries.  It allows the reading of
bulletin board messages randomly or sequentially, listing of the messages in
the bulletin board, and answering messages in the bulletin board.
.*B*
To run DABBLE, do one of the following:
 
   !DABBLE.X
   !DABBLE.X (SELECT ...)
   !DABBLE.X (CHECK ...)
 
The first example just runs DABBLE.  The second does a SELECT command and exits
when it is finished (see HELP (DABBLE.X) SELECT), the third does a check
command and exits when it is finished (see HELP (DABBLE.X) CHECK).
.*B*
DABBLE keeps track of the highest message that you have seen in each meeting in
a file called :DABBLE in your logon file directory.  If, for example, you
haven't seen messages 5-7 of MOVIES and you then display 7, DABBLE will not
know that you haven't seen 5 or 6 the next time you look at MOVIES.  Entries
are placed in :DABBLE when you SELECT a bulletin board and DISPLAY at least one
message, and can also be recorded manually with the REMEMBER command.
 
DABBLE sets TERMINAL PAGEHALT so that messages longer than your terminal's
screen won't get displayed faster than you can read them.  DABBLE will restore
the original setting of PAGEHALT when it exits.

.*K* CHANGES
08/15/90 [by Mark Geisert]
.*R*
SKIP command has been added, per #29291.  FIRST n, LAST n, NEXT n added to
DISPLAY, LIST, ANSWER, and SKIP commands.  ReplyTo: is displayed only if
different from From:, per #35363.  Current message number and folder saved in
IBEX variables, per #37625.
.*B*
06/13/88 [by J.Lance Wilkinson, Penn State University Libraries]
 
Fixed Moderator interpretation of the Profile Reply-To: field.  If the
VM_PROFILE.REPLY_TO$ pointer wasn't Addr(NIL), it sometimes was not what it
should be.
.*R*
06/02/88 [by J.Lance Wilkinson, Penn State University Libraries]
 
Added Moderator interpretation of the Profile Reply-To: field.  If a Reply-To:
is present in the Profile of a folder being used as a Bulletin Board, ANSWERS
to messages will include a COPY: to this address rather than the Bulletin Board
name, allowing for Moderated Bulletin Boards.
.*R*
05/03/88 [by J.Lance Wilkinson, Penn State University Libraries]
 
Added DABBLE_X_UNIQUE command variable.  If this command variable exists, and
the first character of its value is "Y" or "y", then DABBLE will use
:DABBLE_username rather than :DABBLE, the same action previously triggered when
the user is logged on to ZZZCUST.  This was implemented by the HLSUA Exchange
Division management so their same account/multiple user logons could use
discrete :DABBLE files, too.
.*R*
01/26/88
.*R*
Widened message number field by 1, narrowed subject field by 1.
.*R*
02/25/87
.*R*
Now it won't set the current message to a number greater than the highest
mailgram number in the bulletin board.
.*R*
02/19/87 [by Carl Eichert]
.*R*
Added DABBLE_X_PAGEHALT command variable processing.  For more information type
 
    !HELP (DABBLE.X) PAGEHALT
.*R*
02/24/86
.*R*
Linefeed didn't work as a substitute for the NEXT command.
.*R*
02/14/86
.*R*
The LIST command now displays meaningful Internet addresses for messages posted
by the Multics Mail gateway.
 
The DISPLAY command now places the message number and date on one line, rather
than two, and displays the REPLY TO address if it's different from the FROM
address.
 
The ANSWER command now uses the REPLY TO address.
 
Several changes have been made to the command parser to make DABBLE more
compatible with MAIL.  Specifically:  linefeed now means "NEXT", "^" means
"PREVIOUS", and a blank is no longer required before a message- number
selection.
.*R*
08/01/85 [by Frank Mayhar]
 
SELECTing a new bulletin board file will now display "message m of n", where
"m" is the first readable message, instead of "message 1 of n," per star 24858.
 
Added the ATTACH command, to allow entry of a set of commands to be executed
once per selected bulletin board, when using SELECT ALL.
.*R*
6/6/85
 
SELECTing a specific meeting (as opposed to SELECT ALL) now assumes that the
meeting should be FORCEd open, even if no new messages exist.
 
If a REMEMBER'ed meeting is closed (the mailbox is deleted), DABBLE will
automatically FORGET about the meeting when it receives the "File does not
exist" error from file management.
 
A couple of bugs which caused context information to be lost (not written to
the :DABBLE file) have been repaired.
 
DABBLE updated to be compatible with A02 MAIL headers, as well as with A00 and
A01.
 
DABBLE will now recover properly (by aborting a DISPLAY) if an entry in a
meeting folder is malformed (has one or more missing or unreadable records).
Previously, DABBLE would report "Can't read record" once for each unreadable or
missing record.
.*R*
5/9/85
.*R*
DABBLE now sets only PAGEHALT, rather than PAGEHALT and PRINTHALT; PAGEHALT is
restored to its original setting upon exit.  At least one blank is now required
as a separator after command keywords.  The "DABBLE A02 here" salutation does
not appear if a one-shot command is entered and DABBLE does not need to prompt
the user for further commands.
.*R*
4/29/85
.*R*
Modified DABBLE to use :DABBLE_username rather than :DABBLE if the user is
logged on to ZZZCUST.  Fixed HELP file to be LISTHELP-compatible.  Fixed HELP
for the GO command.
.*R*
4/22/85
 
Installed in LADC's X account.  Differences from the UCI version:  the QUIT
command is now called GO;  the SELECT command now has a DISPLAY option as well
as LIST and NOLIST;  oneshot (command-line) SELECT commands may now be used
meaningfully in batch or in noninteractive command files (see the BATCH topic
for details);  DABBLE searches for meetings in both :MEETINGS and :REVIEWS if
an account is not explicitly specified;  miscellaneous minor bug fixes and
tweakings.
.*K* EXAMPLES
For example,
   !DABBLE.X
   >SELECT CP6
   Reading CP6, currently at message 1 of 20
   >DISPLAY 1
   .
   .
   .
.*K* PAGEHALT
The command variable DABBLE_X_PAGEHALT may be set while in IBEX.  It allows the
user to tell DABBLE whether to turn pagehalt on or not.
 
The 3 values that DABBLE understands are:
        'YES'    turn on pagehalt while in DABBLE
        'NO'     turn off pagehalt while in DABBLE
        'DC'     don't change the value of pagehalt
 
For example,
   !LET DABBLE_X_PAGEHALT='NO'
.*K* UNIQUE
The command variable DABBLE_X_UNIQUE may be set while in IBEX.  It allows the
user to tell DABBLE to use a unique :DABBLE_username file rather than the
default :DABBLE tracking file.  This permits multiple users of the same account
to have their own tracking files based on their unique user name (Logon Please:
Account, Username, Password).
 
The 1 value that DABBLE understands is:
        'YES'    use unique :DABBLE_username tracking file
 
Anything else selects the global :DABBLE tracking file.
 
For example,
   !LET DABBLE_X_UNIQUE='YES'
.*K* COMMANDS
DABBLE has the following commands:
 
   ANSWER - answer a bulletin board entry
   ATTACH - set up a set of commands to be executed with SELECT ALL
   CATALOG - tells you what bulletin boards are available

   DABBLE_X_PAGEHALT is a command variable used to set page halt.
 
For more information about this, type !HELP (DABBLE.X) PAGEHALT.
 
   DABBLE_X_UNIQUE is a command variable used to select a unique
           tracking file named :DABBLE_username, where 'username' is
           the user's unique logon to an account shared by multiple
           users who wish to DABBLE separately.

.*K* SELECT
Syntax:
.*R*
SEL[ECT] bbid[,bbid...][ ([FORCE][LIST][NOLIST]) ]
.*R*
SEL[ECT] ALL[ ([FORCE][LIST][NOLIST]) ]
.*B*
The SELECT command tells DABBLE to check the specified bulletin board(s) and,
if there are new entries, open the bulletin board(s) so you can list and
display the messages in that bulletin board.  If you specify more than one
bbid, DABBLE will look at each one in the order you give them after you type
the GO command. 'bbid' can be a regular CP-6 file name (i.e.
DP#packset/file.account.password).  If no account is specified, DABBLE looks
for the meeting in :MEETING;  if it isn't found there, DABBLE looks in
:REVIEWS.
 
The second form tells DABBLE to look at all the entries in :DABBLE and check
each one as if you had typed 'SELECT bbid,...'.  This allows you to read all
the bulletin boards you are interested in without having to type the name of
each one.  See !HELP (DABBLE.X) FORGET for information on how to have DABBLE
forget about a bulletin board you are no longer interested in reading.
 
The FORCE option forces DABBLE to open the bulletin board, even if you have
seen all the messages in it.  This is useful for replying to items that you had
to leave DABBLE to get the answer for.
 
The LIST option tells DABBLE to list the new entries, if any, when opening the
bulletin board.  This is the default.
 
The NOLIST option tells DABBLE to not list the new entries.
 
The DISPLAY option tells DABBLE to display the contents of the new entries when
opening the bulletin board.
 
Some examples:
 
>SELECT CP6
.*R*
>SELECT CP6,PROGRAMMING,MOVIES(NOLIST)
.*R*
>SELECT CP6(FORCE,NOLIST)
 
Also see the ATTACH command.
.*K* CHECK
Syntax:
.*R*
C[HECK] bbid[,bbid...]
.*R*
C[HECK] ALL
.*B*
The CHECK command tells DABBLE to check the specified bulletin board(s) and
tell you if there are any new entries (CHECK says nothing at all about bulletin
boards which contain no new entries.  The second form tells DABBLE to check all
the bulletin boards in :DABBLE and is equivalent to typing 'CHECK bbid,...'.
If you are no longer interested in having CHECK ALL check a bulletin board, see
!HELP (DABBLE.X) FORGET.
 
For example,
 
>CHECK CP6
 CP6 - 4 new entries
 
>CHECK CP6,PROGRAMMING,MOVIES
 CP6 - 4 new entries
 PROGRAMMING - 2 new entries
 MOVIES - 11 new entries
 
.*K* FORGET
Syntax:
.*R*
FOR[GET] bbid[,bbid...]
.*R*
FORGET ALL
.*B*
The FORGET command tells DABBLE to remove the entry for the specified bulletin
board from your :DABBLE file.  FORGET ALL tells DABBLE to forget all the
bulletin boards you have looked at.
 
For example
 
>FORGET CP6
   Bulletin board CP6 forgotten
 
>FORGET ALL
   Bulletin board CP6 forgotten
   Bulletin board PROGRAMMING forgotten
   Bulletin board MOVIES forgotten
 
.*K* REMEMBER
Syntax:
.*R*
REM[EMBER] bbid[,bbid...]
.*B*
The REMEMBER command tells DABBLE to remember a bulletin board in your :DABBLE
file without trying to read it.  This command is useful when a bulletin board
has been created, but no entries have been made yet.  See the FORGET command to
remove a bulletin board from :DABBLE.
 
For example
 
>REMEMBER CP6
   Bulletin board CP6 remembered
 
.*K* STATUS
Syntax:
.*R*
STA[TUS]
.*B*
The STATUS command prints a list of bulletin boards that you have looked at
(the list is in the :DABBLE file).  For example,
 
>STATUS You have entries for the following bulletin boards
      CP6
      HUMOR
      PROGRAMMING
      MOVIES
 
.*K* END
Syntax:
.*R*
E[ND]
.*B*
The END command causes DABBLE to exit.
 
.*K* X
Syntax:
.*R*
X
.*B*
The X command causes DABBLE to exit.
.*K* SEND
Syntax:
.*R*
SEN[D] [fid]
.*B*
The SEND command functions just like the SEND command in MAIL.  For more help
on this command, type HELP (MAIL) SEND.
 
.*K* SKIP
Syntax:
.*R*
SK[IP] [MESSAGE] [ [m1[-m2]] | NEW | ALL ]
.*B*
SKIP skips message(s).  Does everything DISPLAY does, except that it does not
actually display the message(s).
 
.*K* DISPLAY
Syntax:
.*R*
DI[SPLAY] [MESSAGE] [ [m1[-m2]] | NEW | ALL ]
.*B*
DISPLAY displays message(s).  m1 and m2 are message numbers, NEW is displays
all messages you haven't seen yet, ALL is all messages in the bulletin board.
No argument displays the currently selected message(s) (from a previous NEXT,
PREVIOUS, LIST, ANSWER or DISPLAY command).  If an argument is given, it
becomes the new selected message list.
 
Some examples
 
>DISPLAY 1-5
.*R*
>DISPLAY NEW
.*R*
>DISPLAY ALL
.*R*
>DISPLAY 1
.*R*
>DISPLAY
 
.*K* LIST
Syntax:
.*R*
L[IST] [MESSAGE] [ [m1[-m2]] | NEW | ALL ]
.*B*
LIST lists messages in a bulletin board.  The message number, a flag indicating
whether it is a message you haven't seen yet, the date sent, the sender and the
subject are listed.  No argument lists the currently selected message(s) (from
a previous NEXT, PREVIOUS, LIST, ANSWER or DISPLAY command).  If an argument is
given, it becomes the new selected message list.
 
The output from LIST looks like this:
 
 191n 10/24   34 Ritt Conroy            EDIT, A Friendly Word of Warning
 
The 191 is the message number.  The 'n' after it means that you haven't seen
the message.  It's a blank if you have already seen the message.  This is
followed by the date the message was sent, the number of lines in the message,
the name or account of the person that sent it, and the subject of the message.
 
Some examples
 
>LIST 1-5
.*R*
>LIST NEW
.*R*
>LIST ALL
.*R*
>LIST 1
.*R*
>LIST
 
.*K* NEXT
Syntax:
.*R*
N[EXT]
.*B*
NEXT displays the next message in the bulletin board.  It sets the selected
message list to the message it is displaying.
 
.*K* PREVIOUS
Syntax:
.*R*
P[REVIOUS]
.*B*
PREVIOUS displays the previous message in the bulletin board.  It sets the
selected message list to the message it is displaying.
 
.*K* ANSWER
Syntax:
.*R*
AN[SWER] [MESSAGE] [ [m1[-m2]] | NEW | ALL ]
.*B*
ANSWER answers message(s) in the bulletin board.  This allows you to make
comments on existing messages on the bulletin board.  No argument lists the
currently selected message(s) (from a previous NEXT, PREVIOUS, LIST, ANSWER or
DISPLAY command).  If an argument is given, it becomes the new selected message
list.
 
.*K* GO
Syntax:
.*R*
G[O]
.*B*
The GO command causes DABBLE to step to the next bulletin board given in the
SELECT command, if any are left.
 
.*K* USE
The USE command functions just like the SELECT command.  Type !HELP (DABBLE.X)
SELECT for more information.
 
.*K* READ
The READ command functions just like the SELECT command.  Type !HELP (DABBLE.X)
SELECT for more information.
 
.*K* HELP
Syntax:
.*R*
HELP [(processor)] [TOPICS] [keyword1][ - ][keyword2]
.*B*
Parameters:
.*R*
processor    specifies a program or processor that has a HELP file.  The
default is the processor currently being used.
 
TOPICS    specifies that only a list of available topics (message names) is
required.  The range of topics is determined by keyword1 or keyword2.
 
keyword1    specifies the name of the message to be printed.
 
keyword2    if range is specified (by including a dash "-"), keyword2 is the
upper limit of the range.
 
If a range is not specified, keyword2 is a submessage, or category within a
message.
.*K* CATALOG
Syntax:
.*R*
CAT[ALOG] [.acct]
.*B*
The CATALOG will tell you what bulletin boards are available.  If no account is
specified, .:MEETING is used.  Otherwise, the specified account is used.
.*K* OUTPUT
Syntax:
.*R*
OUT[PUT] [{ON|TO|INTO|OVER} fid]
.*B*
The OUTPUT command directs output from DABBLE to a specified destination, such
as a line printer.
 
The options are:
.*R*
ON|TO    specifies file creation.  If the file already exists, attempts to
         output results in an error condition and the output operation will
         not be performed (the default).
 
INTO    specifies file extension.  If a file does not exist, a file is
        created.  If a file does exist, the output is appended to it.
 
OVER    specifies file replacement.  If a file does not already exist, a file
        is created.
 
fid    specifies the file or destination for output.
.*B*
Examples:
.*R*
To output messages to the line printer, type:
 
    >OUTPUT ON LP
    >DISPLAY MESSAGE 1-3
 
Messages 1-3 are printed at the line printer.
.*K* ATTACH
Syntax:
.*R*
AT[TACH] [ S[AVE] | D[ELETE] | L[IST] ]
 
.*B* DESCRIPTION
The ATTACH command is used to logically "attach" a list of up to seven commands
to the SELECT ALL command.  The list of commands will be executed once for each
bulletin board found containing new messages. When the ATTACH command is
issued, DABBLE begins prompting the user for the list of commands.  As he
enters each command, DABBLE syntax checks and stores it.  When he later enters
a SELECT ALL command, and DABBLE finds a bulletin board containing new entries,
the commands are executed in the order they were entered.
 
If the ATTACH command is used alone, the list of commands is forgotten when the
user leaves DABBLE.  This may be avoided by using the SAVE option, which causes
DABBLE to store the list of commands in the :DABBLE file.  The list is then in
effect whenever the user enters DABBLE.  To later delete this stored list, use
the DELETE option of the ATTACH command.  This removes the stored list.  To see
the list of commands, use the LIST option.
 
.*B*
Several commands may be used in an attachment list.  The most useful of these
are the LIST, DISPLAY and GO commands.  The rest are less useful (some are only
included for completeness sake).  They are the NEXT, PREVIOUS, STATUS and
CATALOG commands.  If the GO command is used, it must be the last command in
the list (although DABBLE doesn't check this), as execution of the GO command
resets the attachment list pointer, so that when a new bulletin board is
processed, the commands are executed from the beginning of the list.
 
When entering commands into the list, you are prompted by the string
"Attachment n>" where "n" is the (zero-based) sequence number of the command.
Any DABBLE command entered that may not be included in an attachment list will
be flagged as a syntax error.  Any of the "freebie" commands may be entered,
and will be executed immediately, and not stored.  When you are finished
entering commands into the list, enter any of a blank line, E/ND, Q/UIT or X/IT
to return to DABBLE command level.

.*K* MODERATOR MODERATED
A Moderated Bulletin Board is used when participants do not actually submit
messages to the visible bulletin board, but rather to an individual whose task
is to review (and possibly edit) the messages, and then place them into the
visible bulletin board.
 
DABBLE users who use the ANSWER command are effectively sending their reply not
only to the originator of the bulletin board message, but also to the bulletin
board through the CP-6 MAIL Copy: feature.  But a moderated bulletin board
doesn't want to recieve such messages so DABBLE needs to know where instead to
send the reply.  Enter the Moderator specification, which must be entered using
CP-6 MAIL.
 
With CP-6 MAIL, the bulletin board is opened as a mail folder using the MAIL
command USE:
 
      !MAIL
      > USE /BB.:MEETING
 
The CP-6 MAIL command PROFILE is next used to define a REPLY TO recipient, who
will be the Moderator for the Bulletin Board.
 
      > PROFILE REPLY TO = Bulletin Board Moderator
 
A maximum of 31 characters may be used for the REPLY TO recipient in order for
DABBLE to use it as a Moderator address.  If no REPLY TO recipient is defined
in a folder's profile, then DABBLE will use the bulletin board name as the
Copy: address on any ANSWER commands, and the bulletin board will not be a
truly moderated bulletin board.  The same holds true if the REPLY TO recipient
exceeds 31 characters; this is a constraint imposed by previous coding in
DABBLE.
