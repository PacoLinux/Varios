PRIVCHECK is a tool which checks running user's privileges against the
privileges they were authorized for (in their :USERS records).
.*B*
To use, type:
.*R*
!PRIVCHECK.X  [{ON|OVER} ,output_fid ]
 
The running user must have FMSEC privilege or access to :USERS.:SYS; the
running user must also have SPCLMM privilege.
 
Output is through M$LO.  :USERS is read through M$USERS.
 
Output is of the form:
 useracct usernamexxxx  PPRIV ON=xxxxxxxxxxxx AUTH=xxxxxxxxxxxx !ccbuf
          (If the processor privileges don't match)
 useracct usernamexxxx   PRIV ON=xxxxxxxxxxxx AUTH=xxxxxxxxxxxx !ccbuf
          (If the privileges don't match)
 useracct usernamexxxx  THIS USER IS NOT AUTHORIZED AT ALL!!!!  !ccbuf
          (If the user cannot be found in :USERS)
 
Note: The ccbuf is stripped of leading blanks before being placed in the
exceptions report.
