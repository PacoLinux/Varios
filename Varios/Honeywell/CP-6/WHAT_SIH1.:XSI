    WHAT.X displays most information the M$MONINFO call returns
(except MONPTRS) in a more or less readable format.  By default,
WHAT.X displays the SITE_ID which when run on the L66A or L66B at LADC
will say: 'You're on the L66x'.  Otherwise, it says 'Site ID= x'.  You
may also specify a specific group(s)(ex: MONINFO) or item(s)
(ex: SALUTATION) or ALL to get everything.
 
For a list of available options, type '?' or 'HELP (WHAT.X) TOPICS'
For a description of a specific option, type 'HELP (WHAT.X) option'
For a description of all options, type 'HELP (WHAT.X) A - Z'
