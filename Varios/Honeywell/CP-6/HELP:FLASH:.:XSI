FLASH (Friendly LCP6/ASYNC Stats Harvester) reads a listing from Stats's "Di
Fep X" command and produces a datafile containing one record per snapshot.  It
is assumed that the input listing contains more than one snapshot; this is not,
however, strictly necessary.  Currently, only the LCP6 and Async stats are
munged; all other handlers are ignored.
Command line syntax for FLASH is:
 
      !FLASH.X  inputfid  [ ON | OVER | TO ] outputfid

Submitted to LADC X account.
FLASH expects to look at the complete output listing from Stats's "Di Fep X"
command.  The listing may be captured by setting M$LO to a file.  For long-term
Stats gathering, it is most efficient to log the info in a file, and then
produce the listing later via the Replay commmand.  Type ? for examples . . .
The following JCL fragments illustrate how to generate a Stats listing for
FLASH:
 
      !Set M$LO *Listing
      !Stats
         Int 5          "Set the interval; may be anything Stats will take
         Di Fep X 3     "Select a Fep to grab stats for
         Go 144         "grab 144 snapshots (12 hours worth)
         End
      !Reset M$LO
      !FLASH.X *Listing over *Datafile
 
Type ? for an example using Replay
 
      !Stats "in a ghost job somewhere
         File STATS:FEP3_870219
         Log Fep 3
         Int 5
         Go 144
         End
      !"
      .
      .
      !Set M$LO *Listing
      !Stats
         File STATS:FEP3_870219
         Di Fep X 3
         Replay
         End
      !Reset M$LO
      !FLASH.X *Listing over *Datafile

FLASH produces a file of fixed-length (201 byte) records with the following
format:

list is more than welcome to modify the program.  Please send any updates you
might come up with to LADC for inclusion in a later version of FLASH.X
