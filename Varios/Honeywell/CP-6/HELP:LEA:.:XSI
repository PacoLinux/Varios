     LEA Lists Extended Attributes consicesly.
Invoke LEA as a processor by saying --
      !LEA.X fid  [ON ,lfid]  [(NORU|RUONLY)]
Input "fid" may be a question-mark fid to see attributes of
a range of files.  Attributes are listed to "lfid".  Each
file makes a one-line display of file organization, type,
creation date/time, modification date/time, and file name.
If you have FMSEC turned on, file's creator is also shown.
If you didn't specify (NORU), files which are run units get
an additional one to three line display.  First line shows
creation UTS, severity, what version linker was used,
run unit's privileges (12 octal digits), and other options
(as letters SLAOPN$RL).  Second line if run unit was
RUM'ed shows last rum time and # times rumed.  Third line
shows names of library and asl if any.
If you specify (RUONLY), you only get displays for run units.
   Options meant by those funny letters --
      S  Shareable
      L  SLIB        shared library
      A  ASLIB       alternate shared library
      O              overlaid
      P  PROCACC     processor accounting
      N  NOCHGPMEM   don't charge for procedure pages
      $  SURCHARGE   do step accounting for charges
      R  WLOCK,SLOCK restricted processor
      L  SLOCK       strongly restricted processor
No more HELP is available for LEA.
