FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=80)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
DRAW converts PL-6 DCL statements to pictures, for use in debugging PL-6
structures, design specs, tech manuals.  Any valid structure is accepted, with
some concessions to system MACRO's (STCLASS, PFMT, DCL with name FPTN will be
drawn as MACRO name if any).  Input may be source or OU (L66 or L6) and will be
treated appropriately.
.*B* SYNTAX INVOCATION
Invocation syntax:
 
 !DRAW.X [source[,update]] [ON/OVER [equout][,listout]] [(options)]
 
where source, update, and listout are FID's and are assigned to the M$SI, M$UI,
and M$LO DCBs respectively.  If the M$UI FID name is :, the M$SI FID name will
be substituted. Page headers will normally be put on the beginning of each
page. If this is not desired, they will be supressed if output is to a
CONSECutive file.  Use HELP (DRAW.X) OPTIONS for info about the options.
.*K* OPTIONS
Options are specified in parentheses on the command line.  Keyword options are
two required characters, with the optional part spelled however you like, as
long as it doesn't match a keyword.  Separation of options is not required,
except to avoid keyword matches, and to delineate the names for the
ou-name:item-name option.  Any separator character(s) can be used.
.*B* NARROW
NA[RROW]
.*R*
- If specified, uses a format that will fit in 78 columns, else will fit in 109
columns. If M$LO.WIDTH# is meaningful, it will select wide or narrow, but
option will override.
.*B* LBL
[N]LB[L]
.*R*
- If specified, labels which don't fit in fields will be broken out separately.
The default is ~NA.
.*B* LS
[N]LS
.*R*
- If specified, list the source for each DCL and the enclosing Macro text, if
any. The default is LS.
.*B* UI
[N]UI
.*R*
- If specified, the update source code is to be read from the M$UI DCB.  The
default is UI if an update FID is specified in the invocation line, otherwise
the default is NUI.
.*B* LALL
[N]LA[LL]
.*R*
- If specified, list all source text.  The default is NLA.  LA, if specified,
overrides NLS.
.*B* LKEYS
[N]LK[EYS]
.*R*
- If specified, print key or sequential record number with source text which is
printed by the LS or LA option.  The default is NLK.
.*B* OUNAME ITEMNAME
[ou-name]:[item-name]
.*R*
- where at least one of the names is needed to be useful.  ou-name specifies
that only one of the object units in a batch-compiled object file is to be
DRAWn.  item-name specifies (possibly additionally) that only one item-name is
to be DRAWn.  item-name need not be a level-1 item, but will otherwise not
necessarily be unique.
.*B* EQU
[N]EQ[U][=n]
.*R*
- If specified, output EQU's acceptable to BMAP or L6ASM through M$OU. The
default is NEQU, except if 'equout' is specified on the command line. EQU's
will only be output for levels <= n. n=2 is the default.  The resultant symbol
will be of the form:
.*R*
LVL1_LVL2_..._LVLN# EQU n (n is word offset from struct)
.*B* BIT
[N]BI[T][=n]
.*R*
- If specified, output EQU's acceptable to BMAP or L6ASM through M$OU. The
default is NBIT.  EQU's will only be output for levels <= n. n=2 is the
default.  The resultant symbol will be of the form:
.*R*
LVL1_LVL2_..._LVLN# EQU n (n is bit offset)
.*B* MASK
[N]MA[SK][=n]
.*R*
- If specified, output EQU's acceptable to BMAP or L6ASM through M$OU. The
default is NMASK.  EQU's will only be output for levels <= n. n=2 is the
default.  The resultant symbol will be of the form:
.*R*
LVL1_LVL2_..._LVLN#M# EQU n (n is a word mask to access the item)
.*B* PL6
[N]PL[6]
.*R*
- Make the EQU's generated as the result of the BIT, EQU, and MASK options in
PL6 format.
