CAT (Copy Any Tape) can be currently used to copy/list any CP-V (PCL or FSAVE)
labeled tape or a GCOS-3 (master or user) save tape.

       FSN        file sequence number(s)
                    Ex: FSN=3
                        FSN=2-10

.*B*
The COPY command is used to copy one or more file from the tape into a single
output file.
.*K* COPYALL CA
Syntax: CA | COPYALL res#sn [/filename] [.account] [(copy_ops)]
                      [TO|ON|OVER|INTO [filename_2] [.account2]]
 
   where:
     res          either FT, XT or GT
     sn           tape serial number
     filename     tape file name (can be wildcarded)
     account      account selection for FSAVE tapes
     copy_ops
       SYS[TEM] = (CPV | GCOS)
       D[ENSITY] = (556 | 800 | 1600 | 6250)
       SFSN       first FSN on this tape reel (default = 1)
       FSN        file sequence number(s)
                    Ex: FSN=3
                        FSN=2-10
                        FSN(1,2-5,6)
     filename_2   CP-6 file name or wildcard templet
     account_2    CP-6 file management account
     copy_ops_2
       TY[PE]   = ty | 'ty'
.*B*
The COPYALL command is used to copy multiple file from the input tape.  File
sequence numbers (FSN) may be combined with wildcard selection and FSAVE
account selection.  An output file name templet can be used.
.*B*
Examples:
 
  COPYALL XT#SAVE OVER .SOMEACCT
      Copies all files from a Xerox labeled tape OVER file of the
      same name in account SOMEACCT.
 
  COPYALL XT#04A0.LENGE6PM/?_SI OVER ?_CPV
      Copies the files from account LENGE6PM on FSAVE tape 04A0 that
      end in "_SI" OVER the files in the current working directory.
      File names will be changed during the copy to make them end in
      "_CPV" instead of "_SI".
.*K* END
Syntax: E[ND] | X | Q[UIT]
.*B*
The END command is used to return control to the command processor, usually
IBEX.
.*K* LIST
Syntax: L[IST] res#sn [/filename] [.account] [(list_ops)]
.*B*
   where:
     res          either FT, XT or GT
     sn           tape serial number
     filename     tape file name (can be wildcarded)
     account      account selection for FSAVE tapes
     list_ops
       SYS[TEM] = (CPV | GCOS)
       A          attributes
       EA         extended attributes
       D[ENSITY] = (556 | 800 | 1600 | 6250)
       SFSN       first FSN on this tape reel (default = 1)
       FSN        file sequence number(s)
                    Ex: FSN=3
                        FSN=2-10
                        FSN(1,2-5,6)
.*B*
The LIST command will list the files on the tape and include file attributes
such as organization, number of records and assign a file sequence number that
may be referenced in subsequent COPYs.

.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
900531
.*R*
Modified CAT so that it used X$WILDFMT correctly.  (#40924)
.*B*
880920
.*R*
Modified CAT to utilize the official XUW Library Services.
.*B*
870709
.*R*
Added updates per star 32440 and UWEC's Vince Streif.
.*B*
04/28/86 JES for SJC
.*R*
Fixed bug that caused occasional loss of front part of records in COBOL source
files.
.*R*
01/10/86  SBC
.*R*
Now handles both BCD and ASCII com-decks.  Also fixed bug that would loose
records when a field had a length of 55 characters.
.*R*
01/13/86  LPH
.*R*
Changed close so CAT nolonger spaces to the end of the current tape file when a
END command is issued!  Also made the creation date correct for GCOS "user
save" tapes.
.*B*
12/17/85
.*R*
Now handles com-decks (which previously would produce 0 record files).
.*R*
01/25/84
.*R*
Three bugs were fixed, the first two fixes were suggested in STAR #18596.  1 --
Lost data condition handled by checking ARS# in M$EI
 
2 -- Check for current account > input spec. account disabled
     (This causes entire tape to be searched on wild-card input
      specifications; this is somewhat inefficient, but beats
      the previous behavior in that it will access the files.)
 
3 -- Fixed the "finger" (on errors) to point to the right place.
