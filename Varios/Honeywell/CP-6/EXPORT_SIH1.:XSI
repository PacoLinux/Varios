     EXPORT WRITES SOURCE AND GCOS8 OBJECT UNIT
     FILES TO MAGNETIC TAPE IN A FORMAT WHICH CAN BE
     COPIED TO A GCOS 8 SYSTEM BY THE GCOS 8 IMPORT
     PROGRAM.
       - SOURCE FILES MAY BE EITHER KEYED OR CONSECUTIVE.
         THEY ARE REFORMATTED INTO GCOS STANDARD
         SYSTEM FORMAT BLOCKS (MEDIA CODE 6).
       - OBJECT UNIT FILES ARE RELATIVE.  THEY ARE NOT
         REFORMATTED.
       - EACH FILE IS IDENTIFIED ON TAPE BY THE GCOS 8
         CATALOG/FILE DESCRIPTION OF THE FILE TO WHICH
         IT WILL BE WRITTEN BY THE IMPORT PROGRAM ON
         GCOS 8.

.*B* DETAIL
INPUT:
   M$SI        THE COMMAND FILE
 
       THE COMMANDS ON THIS FILE SPECIFY WHICH CP6
       FILES ARE TO BE WRITTEN TO THE TAPE FILE AS WELL
       AS THE CAT/FILE STRINGS OF THE RECIPIENT GCOS 8
       PERMFILES.  THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF COMMANDS:
       1.  THE CATALOG COMMAND IS OPTIONAL AND PROVIDES
       A DEFAULT GCOS 8 USERID/SUBCATALOG STRING.
       2.  THE COPY COMMAND IDENTIFIES THE CP-6 FILES
       TO BE COPIED TO THE TAPE FILE.
 
OUTPUT:
   M$GCOS     THE GCOS 8 TAPE FILE
 
       THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF BLOCKS ON THIS FILE.
          - THE IDENTIFICATION BLOCK
            THERE IS ONE IDENTIFICATION BLOCK FOR EVERY
            FILE ON THE TAPE.  IT CONTAINS THE CAT/FILE
            STRING OF THE RECIPIENT GCOS 8 PERMFILE.
            THE IDENTIFICATION BLOCK ALWAYS PRECEDES THE
            DATA BLOCK(S).
          - THE DATA BLOCK
            THE ACTUAL FILE CONTENTS ARE ON DATA
            BLOCK(S).
          - THE TOTAL BLOCK
            THERE IS ONE TOTAL BLOCK AT THE END OF THE
            TAPE. IT CONTAINS AN ACCUMULATED TOTAL COUNT
            OF THE FILES ON THE TAPE.
 
   M$LO       THE REPORT FILE
 
       THIS FILE WILL DEFAULT TO THE TERMINAL, HOWEVER
       A !SET M$LO COMMAND CAN DIRECT IT TO A SPECIFIC
       CP-6 FILE.  IT CONTAINS ALL OF THE REPORT AND ERROR
       MESSAGES.
DESCRIPTION:
 
      THE COMMAND FILE LISTS ALL THE FILES TO BE COPIED
      TO THE GCOS 8 TAPE.  IT MAY ALSO INCLUDE ONE OR MORE
      DEFAULT USERID/SUBCATALOG STRINGS FOR THE GCOS 8
      FILENAMES.
 
      COMMAND TYPES:
 
      1. CATALOG (OPTIONAL)
 
              CAT[ALOG] USERID/[SUBCATALOG]...
       SPECIFIES THE DEFAULT USERID AND/OR SUBCATALOG
       STRUCTURE FOR SUBSEQUENT COPY COMMANDS.
 
       2. COPY
 
              C[OPY] <FID> [TO GCOS8-FILENAME]
       SPECIFIES A FILE TO BE WRITTEN TO THE GCOS TAPE FILE.
       THE GCOS 8 FILENAME IS OPTIONAL.  WHEN IT IS NOT
       EXPLICITLY STATED, THE GCOS 8 NAME IS DERIVED FROM
       THE CP-6 FID ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING RULES:
          - ANY '$' OR ':' CHARACTER IN THE CP-6 FID
            IS REPLACED WITH '.' AND '-' RESPECTIVELY.
          - WHEN A CATALOG COMMAND HAS SET A DEFAULT VALUE,
            THE FILENAME IS CONCATENATED WITH THE DEFAULT
            USERID/SUBCATALOG STRING.
.*B*EXAMPLE SAMPLE
EXAMPLE:
 
     CALL=
          !SET M$SI INPUT_FILE
          !SET M$GCOS FT#GCOSTAPE
          !EXPORT.X
 
     FILE CONTENT:
 
     INPUT_FILE
 
          CATALOG BRENDA$BCV/CP6CATA
          COPY TEST_SI
          C TEST_G8OU TO TEST_OU
          C TEST_JCL TO TEST/JCL
 
     THE THREE FILES ARE WRITTEN TO TAPE, IDENTIFIED BY
     THE GCOS 8 CATALOG/FILE DESCRIPTIONS:
 
          BRENDA$BCV/CP6CATA/TEST_SI
          BRENDA$BCV/CP6CATA/TEST_OU
          TEST/JCL
