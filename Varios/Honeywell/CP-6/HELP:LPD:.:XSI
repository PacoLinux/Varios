LPD is a print server for lpr clients on a TCP/IP LAN.
LPD, after being started by INETD, receives commands and data
across a TCP connection from a remote client. CP6 LPD supports
the lpr, lpq, and lprm commands.
LPD must be installed in .:SYS in order to run correctly.

Changed to use lpd:user_equiv.:SYS instead of etc:user_equiv, because
NFS will use etc:user_equiv.:SYS.

This version of LPD should be invoked from within an xeq file to
reduced the amount of superfluous output generate each time INETD
starts the ghost.
For example:
 
    !LPD
    !IF STEPCC = 0 THEN GOTO NO_OUTPUT
    !END
    !NO_OUTPUT:
    !SET M$LL NO
    !LDEV LP01,ERASE
LPD requires the following files to operate correctly:
 
    etc:printcap.:SYS   - defines LPD queue names as CP6 LDEV options
    lpd:user_equiv.:SYS - maps remote users to CP6 users
    etc:lpdstats.:SYS   - maps LPD job numbers to CP6 sysids
 
These files are required in addition to the files required for the
operation of TCP/IP on CP-6. See NETWORK_FILES for a brief description
of the entries required in other files for LPD to operate correctly.
etc:printcap
 
This file maps LPD/Unix queue names to CP-6 LDEV options. The queue
names must match queue names in the remote system print definition
file. Any valid LDEV options are allowed. This is a text file built
using any editor.
 
Example:
 
# Unix queue name        CP-6 LDEV options
 
  cp6lp                  LP@LOCAL
  cp6long                LP@LOCAL,FORM=LONG
  cp6upstairs            LP@UPSTAIRS
  cp6lz                  LZ@UPSTAIRS
lpd:user_equiv
 
This file maps remote user ID's to CP-6 accounts. LPD changes itself
into the specified CP-6 account to provide accurate accounting
information. Records in this file are of the form:
 
      remote_host:remote_user   CP6_account,CP6_username
 
The file is searched sequentially with each entry compared to the host
and user ID received by LPD. LPD uses the account information from
the first record that matches. Wildcarding of the remote host and
remote user are allowed using '*'.
 
When there is a match using a wildcarded remote user, the output is
printed with the remote host in the account field and LPD's remote
user ID in the account name field. LPD will log off as the specified
CP-6 user found in the lpd:user_equiv record.
 
    xps1:bsmith     ADMSMITH,BSMITH   Allow specific user from a
                                      specific host
       *:bsmith     ADMSMITH,BSMITH   Allow this user from any host
    dpx1:100*       100JONES,INTRO    Allow a class of users from
                                      a specific host
       *:*          :SYSLPD,LPD       Allow any users from any host
etc:lpdstats
 
This file is created and maintained by LPD. It has one record per
job with Unix user name, job name, job number queue and the CP-6
sysid and subfile number. Each record is kept until the job is
printed or deleted.
 
The file is created the first time a print job is submitted.
 
The lpr/lpd protocol supports approximately 20 different options
for formatting, file types, fonts, and *roff output file.
All, except the jobname option, are ignored by CP-6 LPD.
Entries are required in etc:services.:SYS and etc:inetd_conf.:SYS
for LPD to run correctly. The etc:services file should contain a
record defining a printer service on port 515 using TCP with an alias
of "spooler". The file is shipped containing this record.
 
The etc:inetd_conf file will need to have a record added for each Unix
FEP. For example:
 
printer/xps1   stream   tcp       nowait   :SYSLPD,LPD,toad !xeq $lpd
printer/dpx2   stream   tcp       nowait   :SYSLPD,LPD,toad !xeq $lpd
 
 
The printer service may not be provided on any CP-6 Unix FEP. Refer
to HA26, CP-6 TCP/IP Referance Manual for configuration details.
Tim Cashin, LADC
Lpr clients running on PC-based systems have been found to
lack some degree of user error trapping compared their Unix
counterparts. Unix lpr clients interact with lpd servers on the
same system, checking for valid queues and network connections.
When a request is valid, the Unix lpd server makes a connection
to CP-6 LPD. If, for example, a user enters an invalid queue
name, an error is issued and CP-6 LPD doesn't see an invalid
print job.
 
PC-based lpr clients have no method for checking the validity
of queues provided by a lpd server. The data is sent to the
server and the lpr client closes the connection. If CP-6 LPD
encounters an error, it has no way to contact the PC-based
and exits. Note that it can appear to the PC user that his/her
print job disappeared. It did.
The lpr/lpd protocol does not provide for password protection as is
found in others (telnet or ftp, for example). This, combined with
personal computers that can be easily reconfigured, opens up the
possibility of "spoofing", or imitating another user. The worst
case, should this occur, is that an unauthorized user has access
to CP-6 printing facilites.
A "normal" print queue must be established on the remote system, for
example cp6ps, that corresponds to an entry in the CP-6 etc:printcap
file. The remote print queue definition should not any Postscript
options. The entry in the CP-6 etc:printcap file:
 
# Unix queue name        CP-6 LDEV options
  cp6ps                  TI@UPSTAIRS
 
should use LDEV options that refer to a Postscript printer. When
invoking a lpr-based print command on the remote system, this queue
would be used and no Postscript options should be given.
CP-6 LPD supports the protocol described in RFC 1179 (McLaughlin,
August, 1990). The sole purpose in life for CP-6 LPD is to accept
data for printing from network-connected systems and to make that
data available to the CP-6 output management facilities. Refer to
RFC 1179 for any updates to the LPD protocol at a later date.
When INETD gets a connection request for the printer service, it
starts a ghost user which in turn invokes LPD. This works well when
the number of print job from remote host to fairly low. If the volume
of print jobs grows, it might be advantagous to have LPD running
continuously and handling its own incoming connection requests.
 
Most of the code needed for operating LPD in this way is included in
source. Making necessary changes is left as an exercise for the reader.
Data received by LPD is put into temporary files (*?) for processing
after the network connection is closed. Control files are *cf?. Data
file are *df?. JCL used by the ghost invoking LPD to can copy these
to permanent files for later examination. Refer to RFC1179 for a
detailed description.
