CHEKOV turns off the "check altret/argument count" flag on all entry points in
an object unit.
Full command line syntax:
 
!CHEKOV.X object_file
 
where:
 
object_file is a file containing an object unit.  A LEMUR library can be used
as well.
CHEKOV has very limited utility.  It is primarily used to strip the CHECK flags
from LADC-created LEMUR libraries where the argument count checking feature is
undesireable.
