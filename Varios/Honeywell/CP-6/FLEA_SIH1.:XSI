FLEA (Formatted Listing of Elephark Activity) reads a file of data
created by ELEPHARK and produces a formatted listing of the user data
contained in that file.  It may be run in any mode except TP.  FLEA
requires no special privileges to run but must have READ access to the file
produced by ELEPHARK.
.*B*
FLEA may be invoked from IBEX as follows:
    !FLEA.account log-file [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO} ,lst]
where:
    account              is the account where FLEA resides
    log-file (DCB=F$ML)  is the FID of the file created by ELEPHARK that
                         contains the data to be listed.  Default name is
                         MEMORYLOG in the current File Management Account.
    lst      (DCB=M$LO)  is a FID where FLEAs output will go.  Default is ME
.*B*
FLEA processes the 'log-file' sequentially.  Since FLEA obtains information
from the file keys, if the 'log-file' is copied from where ELEPHARK originally
created it, care must be taken to keep it as a keyed file (i.e. don't
specify the NLN PCL option to strip the keys to save space and don't
specify any value for the ORG option other that KEYED).
.*B*
When FLEA encounters a 'H' type record (Header record) it remembers the
Free Page Count and the UTS (Universal Time Stamp) which indicates when the
following User records were snapped.
    After doing the above with the Header record, FLEA procedes to read User
records until another Header record or EOF is encountered.  For each User
encountered, FLEA will list several fields from the users JIT.  These fields
are the same that the ST.X program lists and have the same meaning.

.*K* FILE_FORMAT
ELEPHARK writes two types of records to the output file.  All records are
keyed with the following:
 
    Bytes  Contents
    =====  ========
     1-4   The UTS (Universal Time Stamp) of the snap.  This value will remain
           constant throughout a snapshot.
      5    A record type character:
           'H' - indicates a head record
           'U' - indicates a user record
     6-7   The user number for type U records or binary zero for head records.
 
Record contents are as follows:
 
Head record:
 
    Bytes  Contents
    =====  ========
     1-4   The available free pages of memory at the time of the snap.
 
User record:
 
    Bytes  Contents
    =====  ========
     1-64  The B$U table entry for this user (see B$USER.:LIBRARY for the
           layout of the data).
  65-1048  The JIT entry for this user (see B$JIT_C.:LIBRARY for the layout
            of the data).
 
These records are fairly large, requiring in excess of one granule for each
four active users per snap.  ELEPHARK will try to allocate file space in
extents equal to the maximum allowed users on the system divided by four.
After each snapshot, an M$TRUNC is performed to ensure that the data are
written to disk.  Also, the MEMORYLOG file is opened with CTG=YES to ensure
that it is preserved through a system recovery or user terminal disconnect.
 
ELEPHARK does no preprocessing of the data it collects other than to eliminate
empty user slots. This is so that it places as small a load as possible on the
system.  All the data from the user table and JIT is dumped so that (a) the
standard structures can be used to access the data and (b) any information may
be pulled from the data file in a post hoc fashion.
