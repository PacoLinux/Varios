LISTER copies selected portions of compiler-produced unit-record listing files
to a printer.
.*B*
Invocation syntax:
 
!LISTER.X fid [{ON|OVER|INTO} [,]destination] [(options)]
 
The file(s) specified by 'fid' are printed to destination.  'fid' may be
wildcarded, or may denote the beginning of a range of files if the END=filename
option is used.  Default options are LS and LU.  Default destination is LP01.
 
Options are:
 
LO       - list the object-listing portion of the file.
.*R*
[N]LU    - list the updates-listing portion of the file.  (PL6 only)
.*R*
OF/FSETS - special hex/octal object code listings (PL6 only)
.*R*
[N]LS    - do list the source portion of the file.
.*R*
PM       - list the procedure-map portion of the file.
.*R*
DM       - list the data-map portion of the file.
.*R*
CR       - list the cross-reference portion of the file.
.*R*
BA[NNER][=name] - put a 2-pg blockletter banner before listing.
.*R*
END[=filename] - list all files from cmd line "fid" to this file
.*R*
BR/EAK=n - Output isll be broken up into chunks of <= n pages.  Default 1000.
.*R*
EDG/MARK(opts) - EDGEMARK.X is invoked with the arguments opts.
.*R*
CMDV/AR=name - Use name as the version in default RIGHT/LEFT edge printing.

.*K* FORMAT COMMAND COMMAND_FORMAT
LISTER is called as follows:
 
!LISTER.X fid [{ON|OVER|INTO} [,] destination] [(options)]
 
"fid" is the name of the file(s) to print.  If "fid" contains no ?  character
and the END option is not specified, only one file will be listed.  If the
character ? appears in "fid", all files that match "fid" up to the first ? will
be listed.  See the END option for more information.
 
If no destination is specified and there is no SET for M$LO or #4, LP is used.
If no comma is used in specifying the destination, the DCB actually used is
named #3, not M$LO, which affects using !ADJUST.  Remember, however, that an
assignment to #3 or #4 in the previous job step will be remembered and used by
LISTER.
 
Acceptable options are:
 
LO, LU, NLU, DM, PM, CR, LS, NLS, OFFSETS, BREAK, BANNER, END, EDGMARK, and
CMDVAR.  By default, LS and LU apply.
 
For details, type !HELP (LISTER.X) OPTIONS
 
.*K* OPTIONS
The options behave as follows:
 
LO
       - list the object-listing portion of the file.
 
LU
       - list the updates-listing portion of the file.  Implemented by
searching for a "+" in the first 17 columns of the first non-heading line of
each compile unit, so a %EOD in the update file should be followed by an XUU
comment (e.g., "+* make LISTER work better").
 
NLU
       - don't list the updates-listing portion of the file.
 
OF/FSETS
       - list the object-listing portion of the file, but instead of displaying
the generated code, replace the PL-6 statement number with the octal or
hexadecimal displacement of the generated code into the procedure control
section.  OFFSETS is implemented only for PL-6 listings.
 
LS
       - do list the source portion of the file.
 
 .. more ..
.*B*
PM
       - list the procedure-map portion of the file.
 
DM
       - list the data-map portion of the file.
 
CR
       - list the cross-reference portion of the file.
 
BA[NNER][=name]
       - put a banner at the beginning of the listing.  If "name" is not
specified the banner will be the current file name, otherwise it will be
"name".
 
NLS
       - do not list the source portion of the file.
 
END[=filename]
       - list all files in the account starting with the file specified by
"fid" and ending with the file specified by "filename".  The files specified by
"fid" and "filename" need not actually exist;  they are used as name-range
limits only.  If "filename" is not present, the end of the account is used.
Wild-carding of "fid" (? character) is ignored if this option is used.

.*B*
 
BR/EAK=n
       - The output will be broken up into chunks of <= n pages.  The default
is 1000.
 
EDG/MARK(opts)
       - EDGEMARK.X is invoked with the arguments opts.  If a LEFT=' option is
used, the entire set of files will be EDGEMARKed together, with only the 'VERS'
substitution below.  If no LEFT= option is used, EDGEMARK will be invoked for
each file, and LISTER will build a LEFT= with the same name as was used in the
banner or, if no banner was produced, the name of the input file.  If there is
a LEFT= or RIGHT= option that specifies 'VERS', the string VERS will be
replaced by the version from the listing file.  Note these two differences when
using this option:if the BREAK option is used, it must be an option to EDGEMARK
and the default is to never break; the destination device is moved by LISTER to
position 3 (default *G).  IMPORTANT!  LISTER looks for the strings LEFT= and
LEFT=' ONLY!  The EDGEMARK command abbreviations don't apply.
 
 .. more ..
.*B*
CMDV/AR=name
       - If the first record of the file to be listed contains the text
'VERSION ' in bytes 0 to 7, then the text beginning in byte 8 up to the next
blank will be used as the version of the listing.  If the BA option was
specified, the version will be printed on the listing.  If the EDG option was
specified with VERS for LEFT or RIGHT, then the string VERS will be replaced by
the version.  FInally, if CMDV=name is specified, the command variable name
will be set to the version.
 
.*K* NOTES
The listings are written through M$LO, which is assigned by default to the
'LP01' stream.  The M$LO dcb is closed after each listing is produced.  The
names of the files listed through M$LO are written through M$ME if M$LO is not
assigned to the "ME" device;if there are no files to be listed, the message "No
files to list" is written through M$ME.  If M$LO is assigned to a stream and
EDGMARK is not used, an M$LDEV will be issued to send the accumulated output to
the printer when the output reaches 1000 pages.  For EDGMARK, use the EDGEMARK
BREAK option.
 
LISTER is quite capable of rearranging the listings to fit on paper with a
different length, since it rebuilds the header info by using M$DEVICE.  All
that is needed is that the first header contain a 1 followed by 4 blanks and
preceded by any of most non-alpha characters and that all subsequent headings
have an increasing number in the same 5 columns, or that the headings contain
no page numbers.  By default, LISTER will copy the FORM used for the input file
to the output file, so to change it, the FORM option must be used in a SET for
M$LO or #4.  If output is to a device, the FORM option is only needed if
EDGEMARK is also specified, since LISTER needs to know how big to make the
pages for the temporary file (*LISTER_EDGMRK).  In that case, the LDEV should
specify the "PERF" flavored form, and the SET the "STDLP" one, or the listing
will use the perforation, too.
.*K* EXAMPLES
Examples:
 
!LISTER.X ?.:B00LS (NLS,NUI)
 
Produces, on the line printer, a list of the names of all files in the :B00LS
account, and any error-diagnostic or error-summary lines contained therein.
 
 
!LISTER.X ?.:B00LS ON, LP@ (BANNER)
 
Produces LS-type listings of all files in the :B00LS account.  Since the
listing is being routed to a single-DCB symbiont stream ("LP@") and since the
M$LO DCB is closed after each file, each listing will be placed in the output
queue as a separate symbiont file.  Each listing will begin with a boldface
banner naming the file being listed.

.*B*
!LISTER.X U?.:B00LS (BANNER, LO, DM)
 
Lists the source, object, and data-map portions of the listings for all files
in the :B00LS account whose filenames begin with the letter "U".
 
 
!LISTER.X BLOTTO
 
Lists the LS portion of the file BLOTTO in the user's account.
 
 
!LISTER.X YNOGA.AUXLIST ON, LP@0001 (LO, END)
 
Lists the LS and LO portions of files in the AUXLIST account, beginning with
file "YNOGA", if that file, exists and continuing on to the end of the account.
The listings will be sent to the printer(s) at workstation 0001.
 
 
 .. more ..
.*B*
 
!LISTER.X B.:B00LS OVER LP02 (END=D,BA,EDG(RIGHT='VERS',NA,BR=500))
 
This command will produce listings for all files in the :B00LS account whose
names begin with the letters B or C; it will produce a listing for the file "D"
if that file exists, but will not produce listings for any other files whose
names begin with the letter "D".  The listings will have banners and will be
EDGEMARKed, with the file name on the left and the version on the right.  The
listings will be broken into chunks of 500 pages.
 
 
!LDEV LP02 LP,FORM='PERF8'
.*R*
!SET M$LO LP02,FORM='STDLP8'
.*R*
!LISTER.X B.:B00LS (END=D,BA,EDG(RIGHT='VERS',NA,BR=500))
 
Same as the previous invocation, but changing forms.

.*R*
Copies selected portions of unit-record listing files (produced by PL-6, PL1,
PARTRGE, BMAP, or GMAP6) to the line printer.  For other compilers, the LU/NLU
option and possibly the form-length-change function are all that can be
expected to work.
.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
3/23/92 - Added support for forms change with XREF.X listings.
.*B*
3/9/90 - Added support for C compiler listings - only CR doesn't work.
.*R*
880211 - One more try.
.*R*
880209 - fixed up 880203 LU code so it works more betterly.
.*R*
880203 - moved the LU code so that it works for all compilers.
.*R*
861017 - Call EDGEMARK in standard syntax.  Make "," optional for destination.
.*R*
860405 - Fix OFfsets option for >10 sections (lotsa DCBs)
.*R*
860206 - Fix to make forms change easier, and LEFT=' to EDGEMARK all the files
together. (Use LEFT= to avoid this behavior).
.*R*
860124 - OFFSETS and LU options added. Heading code redesigned for OFFSETS
turns out to allow change of paper length (e.g. STDLP8), too.
