LISTHELP produces printed listings of CP-6 HELP files.
!LISTHELP.X [help-file] [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO} ,listing] [(options [)]]
 
where:
    help-file = M$SI = tool-name, tool-name.account, .account or
                       any wildcarded form of a tool-name.account.
                       tool-name may optionally be preceded by 'HELP:'
                       and followed by ':' forming HELP:tool-name:
    listing   = M$LO = listing destination (default = ME)
LISTHELP will list file(s) that the HELP facility uses(of the form HELP:tool:).
For any tool, LISTHELP will list:
  1) the total number of topics (if any) the tool has
  2) the tools topics with minimal abbreviations indicated
  3) Topic synonyms
  4) Topics and their subtopics
  5) The text indicating help level numbers
Unfortunately, in order to provide some of the functionality LISTHELP
provides (subtopic listing for instance) it is necessary to read the
HELP:tool: file directly (as opposed to using the M$HELP monitor service)
which means one of two things.  Either, the HELP:tool: file must be READable
by the user or LISTHELP.X must be an ACSVEH on the HELP:tool: file.
For a list of available options, type '?' or 'HELP (LISTHELP.X) TOPICS'
For a description of a specific option, type 'HELP (LISTHELP.X) option'
For a description of all options, type 'HELP (LISTHELP.X) A - z'
In the list below, only characters before the slash (/) are required.

Fixed bug that caused a "Divide Check" when a "LISTHELP.X IBEX"
was attempted.  For more information, see star 32100.
08/10/84
Changed the command line parse nodes to required blank(s) around fids on the
command line as needed (STAR 21107).
01/08/84
Check to see if the WIDTH of M$LO is < 83 and if so, adjust the indentation
such that help lines with 79 characters don't wrap as per star #18651.
06/13/83
Fixed PARTRGE nodes for the NOLIST option to match the HELP file.
12/07/82
Added END, FORCE, LIST, NOLIST, START and WIDTH options.  Type:
  HELP (LISTHELP.X) option
for details on any specific option.
CHANGES
NOLIST
E[ND] = name
    Where 'name' is a non-wildcarded name indicating the last tool for
which HELP will be listed.  If 'name' does not begin with 'HELP:', LISTHELP
will assume it does.  If the END option is not specified, the search
continues to the end of the HELP: files.
If the LIST and/or NOLIST options are specified, then only files with names
between the START name and END name and meeting the LIST and/or NOLIST criteria
will be listed.
Note: If both the START and END options are specified and the START name is
      greater than the END name, LISTHELP will search the file directory in
      reverse order so the list really WILL start at the START name and end
      at the END name.
For related HELP, type:
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) START
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) LIST
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) NOLIST

Examples:
  To get a listing of this HELP file on the LP, type:
    !LISTHELP.X LISTHELP.X ON ,LP
 
  To get a complete EDGEMARKed listing of all the HELP in the .X account,
  type (or put in an XEQ file):
    !   LET MONNUM=$SUBSTR($DATE,2,2)
    !   LET MONTHS='JanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec'
    !   LET RIGHT=$SUBSTR(MONTHS,(MONNUM*3)-3,3) || ' ' || $SUBSTR($DATE,4,2)
    !   IF $SUBSTR(RIGHT,4,1) ~= '0' THEN GOTO DATE_OK
    !   LET RIGHT= $SUBSTR(RIGHT,0,4) || $SUBSTR(RIGHT,5,1)
    !DATE_OK:
    !   LISTHELP.X .X OVER ,*HELP
    !   EDGEMARK.X *HELP OVER LP@LOCAL(F='PERF',L='HELP.X',R='%RIGHT')
    !   LET DELETE MONNUM,MONTHS,RIGHT
A more general and universal XEQ file might be something like the following:
    !DONT ECHO
    !   LET MONNUM=$SUBSTR($DATE,2,2)
    !   LET MONTHS='JanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec'
    !   LET RIGHT=$SUBSTR(MONTHS,(MONNUM*3)-3,3) || ' ' || $SUBSTR($DATE,4,2)
    !   IF $SUBSTR(RIGHT,4,1) ~= '0' THEN GOTO DATE_OK
    !   LET RIGHT= $SUBSTR(RIGHT,0,4) || $SUBSTR(RIGHT,5,1)
    !DATE_OK:
    !   LET TOOL=$INPUT('Enter tool name (? for all): ')
    !   IF TOOL = ' ' THEN LET TOOL= '?'
    !   LET ACT=$INPUT('Enter account containing the HELP .')
    !   IF TOOL = '?' THEN GOTO ALL_TOOLS

NOLIST
L[IST] = name  or
L[IST] [=] ( name [,name,...] )
 Where 'name', which may be wildcarded, specifies the tool(s) for which HELP
 is being requested.  If 'name' does not begin with 'HELP:', LISTHELP will
 assume it does.
Example:
 
 !"  The following would list HELP for LISTHELP.X, CMPR.X and all tools
 !"  in the X account with names beginning with 'O'.
 !LISTHELP.X .X (L=(LISTHELP,CMPR,O?)
For related HELP, type:
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) NOLIST
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) PRECEDENCE
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) START
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) END

N[O] [L[IST]] [=] ( name [,name, ...] )  or
N[O] [L[IST]] = name
 Where 'name', which may be wildcarded, specifies the tool(s) for which HELP is
 NOT wanted.  If 'name' does not begin with 'HELP:', LISTHELP will assume
 is does.
Example:
    !"  The following would list HELP for all tools in the X account except
    !"  those with PASCAL anywhere in the name.
    !LISTHELP.X .X (NLS=?PASCAL?
For related HELP, type:

In the following discussion, THIS_TOOL means any tool that LISTHELP is
trying to decide whether or not to list.  It is possible for THIS_TOOL
to meet criteria on both the LIST option and the NOLIST option.  The way
LISTHELP decides whether or not to LIST THIS_TOOL is as follows:
    1) If THIS_TOOL is explicitly (i.e. not wildcarded) mentioned on the LIST
       option, LISTHELP will LIST THIS_TOOL.
    2) If THIS_TOOL meets the criteria on the NOLIST option, it will NOT
       be listed.
    3) If THIS_TOOL meets the criteria on the LIST option, it will be listed.
    4) Otherwise, THIS_TOOL will NOT be listed.
For related HELP, type:
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) LIST
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) NOLIST
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) END
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) START

PRECEDENCE
LIST
S[TART] = name
    Where 'name' is a non-wildcarded name indicating the first tool for
which HELP will be listed.  If 'name' does not begin with 'HELP:', LISTHELP
will assume it does.  If the START option is not specified, the search
starts with the first HELP: file in the account.
If the LIST and/or NOLIST options are specified, then only files with names
between the START name and END name and meeting the LIST and/or NOLIST criteria
will be listed.
For related HELP, type:
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) END
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) LIST
    HELP (LISTHELP.X) NOLIST

W[IDTH] = value
    Where 'value' is between 80 and 132, inclusive and is used as margins for
    building LISTHELPs title line.
This is used when LISTHELPs outputting on something that has a WIDTH that
is wider than you want your listing.
LISTHELP.X
AID=DOCUMENTATION
HELP_FILES
TOOL=LISTHELP
Lists one or more HELP files on the specified destination.
Sample batch LISTHELP JCL for pulling the X account HELP might be:
 
  !JOB
  !RES MEM=255,TIME=20
  !LIMIT LO=99999
  !   LET MONNUM=$SUBSTR($DATE,2,2)
  !   LET MONTHS='JanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec'
