GRAFATBL preprocesses command files for GRAFASLIDE.X to make table-building
easier.
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRAFATBL.X input_file OVER output_file,diag_file
 
where:
 
input_file     is a file of GRAFATBL input DCB is F$10.
 
output_file  is output compatible with GRAFASLIDE.X.  DCB is F$20.
 
diag_file is the place you want the diagnostic messages to go.  DCB is F$108.
 
Please, only use files!  Also, you cannot use the same filename in both
locations.  You probably shouldn't, either, since GRAFATBL may make it
difficult to edit your input if it needs modification.
GRAFATBL input is essentially the same as GRAFASLIDE input, except that you may
include special TABLE-creating directives and data.  Therefore, only the
special TABLE stuff is discussed here:
 
%TABLE
begins table processing.  If automatic indentation is on (see GRAFASLIDE.X), it
will be disabled.  THE %TABLE COMMAND MUST BE FOLLOWED WITH A TABLE-LAYOUT
RECORD.
 
%NTABLE
ends table processing, and restores the automatic indentation setting that was
in effect prior to processing the %TABLE.
 
Between the %TABLE command and the %NTABLE command are a table-layout record,
and table data records.
TABLE LAYOUT RECORDS
A table layout record defines "fields".  Data from table data records are then
inserted in the "fields".  "Fields" can be Right justified, Left justfied, or
Centered.  (Note: Right justification and Centering work best with monospaced
fonts, but reasonable results can be obtained with proportionally spaced fonts
if care is taken during layout.)
 
As an example, here is a table layout record:
 
------------L------C------------R
 
this says:
 
This table has three fields.  The first field begins in column 1, is 13 columns
wide, and should be left justified.  The second field begins in column 14, is 7
columns wide, and should be centered.  The final field is 13 columns wide,
begins in column 22 and should be right justified.
 
Up to 20 fields may be specified.
TABLE DATA RECORDS:
Table data records have the table data in a special format that makes it easy
to locate the data to be inserted in the table.  Data to be inserted in the
table should be separated by the backslash character ("\").  For example:
 
MOTORBYKES\100\>100 H.P.\
 
Note:  The final data item on the line must be followed by a backslash.
 
Note:  It is unwise to have more fields defined in a Table data record than are
defined in the field.  GRAFATBL will produce unpredictable output in that
circumstance.
 
If the column data items contain the character "^" (caret), the caret will be
used to align the column data, but will be translated to space on output.
There are some special "features" in GRAFATBL.  You may specify the table data
item delimiter in the %TABLE command:
 
%TABLE *
 
Would mean to use a * instead of a \ when separating fields.  The separator is
reset back to \ if another %TABLE directive is encountered.
 
If the command
 
%TABLE *$
 
is given, all occurrences of $ in the data string will be translated to a space
on output.
 
The default %TABLE command, of course, is:
 
%TABLE \^
 
A single "S" may be included on the Table definition record.  It means that the
first data item in the table actually begins in that column.  This is how you
get table data to start in a column other than column 1.  For example:
 
----------S-------L-------C-------R
 
Means that the first data column is to start in column 11.
