EDICT prompts the user for inputs according to the Crisman documentation
standards(AF_0091E-0).  It formats the input and creates an output file.
This file is structured to contain the *M*, *P*, *F*, *I*, *0*, *D*, *B*, *K*,
*N* document groups.
     For definitions of these groups type :

.*B*
     Edict is invoked by typing:
 
        EDICT.X [ [ON|INTO|OVER] FID] [OPTION [,OPTION]...]
 
     If FID is specified it will be created, written over or into and it
will contain the output.  Output is the created documentation.
If this field is not entered the created file is named *DOC.
 
.*B*
   The options are:
        S[TART] = VALUE- a fractional number, denoting the start value
                       for the edit keys.
 
        R[IGHTMARGIN] = VALUE- a decimal number, which will delimit the
                             bound of the right margin.
 
        L[EFTMARGIN] = VALUE- a decimal number, which will define the
                            leftmost bound of the documentation file.
        I[NCREMENT] = VALUE- a fractional number, which will delimit the
                           increment factor for the edit keys.
 
        K[EYWORD]L[EFT]= VALUE- a whole decimal number which will
                                denote the column that the leftmost
                                character of the keywords (name,purpose,
                                description, etc...) will be aligned
                                on.
 
        K[EYWORD]R[IGHT]= VALUE- a decimal number which will denote
                                 the column that the rightmost
                                 character of the keywords (NAME,PURPOSE,
                                 DESCRIPTION, ETC...) will be aligned
                                 on.
 
  The defaults are:      (L=10,R=80,S=1.0,I=1.0,KL=5)
 
        Note the rightmargin maximum will default to 132 if it's
           larger than 132.
        The keywords are aligned on their left side in column 5.
        The user cannot specify both keyleft and keyright in the same
        invocation.

   The commands available inside Edict are:
 
         +line#[,line#]   -This is the syntax of the command which
                           will build a plus card at the first line
                           number specified.  Documentation will then
                           continue being inserted after that line in
                           the file.  The increment will then default
                           to count the edit key in .01 increments.
 
         .C(comment field) -The 'comment field' will become the plus

The last changes to EDICT are the addition of commands.  These
commands will allow the user to dynamically change the edit key
for the next record to be inserted, and also change the key increment.
Commands were also added to allow the user to have plus cards made
with EDICT taking care of the date account and comment fields.  The
user can however change the character string that is placed in the
comment field.  For a full description of these commands type:

Type M            This is a one-line description of each module.
                 It must be the first comment line with each
                 module.  There should be only one *M* at the
                 beginning, i.e., don't include blank lines
                 beginning with *M*.  Subsequent *M* lines
                 within a file will change the title line on the

.*K* O
Type O            Operator communication.  This report will track
                  every message that goes to some OC.  Properly
                  formatted, it will provide the appendix to the
                  OPs Manual so keywords are important.  Should

                  definition.

.*K* B BNAME BDESCRIPTION
Type B            These are the data definitions.  All external
                  data bases must contain a definition for each
                  field.  The *B* comment must follow the field
                  it describes.  It's not clear yet but EXTRACT
                  may supply information available with the data
                  declaration like type or size.
 
                             *B* name - description
 
.*K* N NDESCRIPTION NKEYWORD NNAME
Type N            This is where code is to be added to implement
                  features which are being postponed for future
                  builds of the system.  Because of the staging
                  of the system, known features are postponed but
                  it might be easier to flag where they should be
                  implemented in the module rather than figuring
                  it out later.  It might also be useful in
                  identifying minor features that are not
                  supported in each system build, as well as a
                  reminder to the module owner not to forget it.
                  The format is:
 
                       *N* keyword - description
 
.*K* K KNAME KDESCRIPTION
Type K            The *K* may be used for keyword definitions.
                  It is also used for data descriptions to be
                  supplied in user documentation just as *B* is
                  used for data base tech manual.  The Monitor
                  Services Ref Manual, being a user Manual, is
                  created from *K*.
 
                       *K* name - definition
