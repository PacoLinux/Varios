.*A*                                                                           
XREF reads CP-6 object units and produces four sorted lists:
   1. A list of compile-unit names sorted by severity and file-name.
   2. A list of control sections sorted by size, name, type, and OU-name.
   3. A list of level-1 BASED variables sorted by name and OU-name.
   4. A list of ENT-, SYM-, and SEG-DEFs, sorted by name, defining OU-name,
      and referencing OU-name.
 
In lists 2 and 4, a (U) following an OU-name indicates that no relocation
directive references the section or REF.  A (S) denotes an OPTIONAL ENTREF.
 
XREF will also read source files if so directed (INCLXREF option) and
produce a list of INCLUDE filenames sorted by name and including file.
A .n following a filename indicates the compile-unit number.
 
Use XREF as follows:
 
!XREF.acct #1,#2 on/over/into #3,#4(options)
where all parts are optional:
 
   #1 specifies the input source:
      A file of TYPE=XR is a presorted XREF database.
      An account (.acct) creates an XREF database from all its object units.
      Otherwise, #1 contains a list of FIDs to be XREFfed.
   #3 is where to put the XREF database.
   #4 is where to put the formatted listing.
   #2 is where to get a list of OUNAMEs or prefixes if SElect is an option,
      or is where to get updates if INclxref is.
 
   options are any of:
      NBased doesn't include BASED names in formatted output.
      NNames doesn't include OUNAMEs list in formatted output.
      NSects doesn't include SECTIONS in formatted output.
      NIncludes doesn't include INCLUDES in formatted output.
      NDecls doesn't include the rest in formatted output.
      INclxref selects consecutive or EDIT files and XREFs %INCLUDE filenames.
      SElect includes only selected (#2) items, not all other references.
      SElect Names causes selection by name instead of ou.
      NAme Size = n sets the number of characters to be used for names.
         The default is 19.
      Moduleid Size = n sets the number of characters to be used for ounames.
         The default is 11.  The resulting records are NAS+MS+2 bytes long.
 
   Selection list and options are separated by commas and continued by semis.

.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
890516 - INCLxref works with C source and case-blind PL6 directives.
.*B*
880203 - Uses XUU for Inclxref, so that update files can be included.
       - Creates a RELative output file, so that SELNAME works faster.
