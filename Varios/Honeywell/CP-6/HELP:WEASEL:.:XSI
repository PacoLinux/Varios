WEASEL (Watch Entries Accumulated in the SEcurity Log) retrieves and displays
information from security log files.
Invocation syntax:
 
!WEASEL.X
 
Commands are USE, SPAN, TYPE, REPORT, RESET, and END.
 
Type !HELP (WEASEL.X) command_name for details.
 
Type a ? for more about WEASEL.
WEASEL is an ELAN-like processor which may be used to examine the contents of
the system security log files. It may be used either on-line or in batch.
 
As determined by the System Manager, CP-6 logs information about certain
sensitive activities in a daily security log file, :SECLOGyymmdd, where yymmdd
is the ANS format for date. These files are maintained in the :SYS account.
 
WEASEL is not linked with any privileges, so the user must have the necessary
active privileges to allow read access to security log files.
 
When WEASEL is invoked, it attempts to open the current security log file and,
subsequently, reports the first security log file which exists in the :SYS
account. It then awaits further commands.
Minimally, a REPORT command must be issued to initiate production of a display
or report. If only the REPORT command is given, WEASEL will examine and report
all records in the current day's security log file in accordance with the type
of report specified. RAW reports will generate a one line output record for
each security log record.  DETAIL reports will generated multiple line output
records containing all pertinent information for each security log record.  RAW
and DETAIL report records will be output in chronological order with date and
type headers output as appropriate. SUMmary reports will generate a count of
each type of record found in the security log as well as a total. The user may
request that a summary be displayed at the end of either a RAW or DETAIL
report.  The user may also request that any report be written to a file,
stream, or output device other than the default (ME).  Execution of the REPORT
command may be terminated without exiting WEASEL by means of the BREAK key.
WEASEL will print the time and date of the record most recently read and issue
a prompt. If a 'C' for continue is typed, the report will continue. If anything
else is typed, the current report is terminated.
The USE command allows the user to direct WEASEL to look for :SECLOGyymmdd
files in an account other than :SYS.
 
The SPAN command allows the user to specify a time range which will constrain
WEASEL to read and display only those records which were logged during the
specified time frame.
 
The TYPE command allows the user to specify which types of security log records
(file access, privilege change, monitor service, system access, system exit,
ARES checks bypassed) are to be reported.
 
Each of the above commands, except REPORT, remain in effect until another such
command is issued or the command is reset to its default via the RESET command.

CHANGES
The following DCBS are used by WEASEL:
 
M$SI      Command Input M$LO      Report M$DO      Error messages M$SECLOG
Access :SECLOGyymmdd files
Syntax:
 
{ E[ND] | X[IT] | Q[UIT] }
 
The END command causes WEASEL to exit normally.
Georgia Horswell, LADC
Syntax:
 
RE[PORT] {RAW|DET[AIL]|SUM} [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO} fid] [[WITH] SUM[MARY]]
 
REPORT determines the type of report to be produced, where it is to be placed,
and initiates production of the report. If no report fid is specified, the
default is the current destination of M$LO.
Syntax:
 
RES[ET] [ {ALL | reset_list} ]
 
where:
 
reset_list is a list of one or more parameters to be reset to their defaults.
Parameters are: U[SE], S[PAN], and T[YPE].
 
If neither ALL nor a reset_list is specified, ALL is assumed.
Syntax:
 
[SP[AN]] [FROM] start {TO|-} stop              or
[SP[AN]] [FROM] start                          or
[SP[AN]] {TO|-} stop                           or
[SP[AN]] LAST n units                          or
[SP[AN]] TODAY
 
where:
 
start is a date (mm/dd/yy), time (hh:mm), or both (mm/dd/yy,hh:mm or
hh:mm,mm/dd/yy) which specifies where to begin searching in the security log.
 
stop is formatted the same way as start and tells WEASEL to stop searching
records logged after that time.
 
n is an integer.
 
units is one of MI[NUTES], H[OURS], D[AYS], W[EEKS], MO[NTHS], or Y[EARS].
 
The time range given in the SPAN command will remain in effect until another
SPAN command is issued or it is reset to the default by the RESET command.
 
If the SPAN command is not issued or is reset, the time range defaults to today
(today's date,00:00 - today's date,23:59).
Syntax:
 
TYPE {ALL | type_list}
 
where:
 
type_list is a list of one or more security log types, separated by commas.
Types are: S[YSTEM] A[CCESS] (or LOGON), S[YSTEM] E[XIT] (or LOGOFF), F[ILE
ACCESS], P[RIVILEGE CHANGE], M[ONITOR SERVICE], and AR[ES CHECKS BYPASSED].
 
TYPE specifies which type(s) of security log records are to be reported. These
types remain in effect until another TYPE command is issued or TYPE is reset to
the default by the RESET command.
 
If a TYPE command is not issued or is reset, the default is ALL.
Syntax:
 
USE .acct
 
where:
 
.acct is the account which contains the :SECLOGyymmdd files to be
searched.
 
The USE account remains in effect until another USE command is issued or it is
reset by the RESET command.
 
If USE is not specified, :SYS is assumed by default.
