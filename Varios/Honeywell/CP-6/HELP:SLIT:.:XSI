Status LIne Time (SLIT) activates the builT-in clock of terminals having the
feature.
SLIT checks the terminal type to see if it has a built-in clock as part of the
status line.  If it does it gets the current time from the system clock.  It
then sends the control sequence to initialize the clock.

SYNTAX
Lee Hallin, LADC
[PROFILE=] profile
    Specifies what terminal profile that you wish to set the clock in.  If
    this PROFILE option is not specified, the current profile will be used.
    For a list of supported profiles, type another ?.
Currently supported terminals:
 
     VIP7801FC
     VIP7814
     BEEDM20
 PCT (pc terminal product)
     PCTX364, PCTX364GR, PCTV7800, PCTV7800GR, PCTV7800INV
00001
Syntax:
    !SLIT.X [profile] [( options [)] ] where options are:
    T[IME]=  - number_of_hours_back
    T[IME]= [+] number_of_hours_ahead
    [PROFILE=] profile
 
If no "profile" is specified, the current profile will be used.
 
For a list of supported profiles, type !H(SLIT.X) PRO SUPPORTED
T[IME] [=] - number_of_hours
    Specifies the number of hours to be subtracted from the CP-6 time.
    For instance, a Hawian user of the LADC L66A might specify TIME=-2 to
    adjust for the 2 hours difference between Los Angeles (LADC L66A) and
    Hawaii.
T[IME] [=] [+] number_of_hours
    Specifies the number of hours to be added to the CP-6 time.  For instance,
    a New York user of the LADC L66A might specify TIME=+3 to adjust for
    the three hour time difference between Los Angeles (LADC L66A) and New
    York.
