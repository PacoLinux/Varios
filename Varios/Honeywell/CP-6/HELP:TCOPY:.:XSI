TCOPY is a semi-blind tape copy/verify program used to create and/or verify
identical duplicates of magnetic tape sets.  TCOPY handles single- and
multi-volume tape sets in both copy and verify modes; each reel of a
multi-volume set needs be mounted but once to copy and verify the entire tape
set.
Invocation syntax:
 
   !TCOPY FT#nnnnnn[#mmmmmm...] [OVER FT#kkkkkk[#llllll...]] [(options)]
 
       - or -
 
   !SET M$EI FT#nnnnnn[#mmmmmm...]
  [!SET M$EO FT#kkkkkk[#llllll...]]
   !TCOPY  [(options)]
 
TCOPY must be installed in .:SYS or the invoking user must have FMSEC privilege
active for TCOPY to work properly.

TCOPY uses M$EI as the source/master tapeset, and M$EO as the
destination/duplicate tapeset.  These dcbs may be set on the TCOPY invocation
line as positional DCBs #1 and #3, respectively, or they may be set prior to
invocation via IBEX !SET commands.  If M$EO is not assigned, TCOPY will assume
FT#TCPY00[#TCPY01...].  The number of reels specified for M$EO must not be less
than the number of reels specified for M$EI; up to 100 reels may be specified
for a single tapeset.

The following sub-topics contain examples of TCOPY usage, with an explanation
accompanying each detailing the results of the command given.  Type  ?  for
each succeeding example, or  ??  for all the available examples.
 
Example 1 --
 
      !TCOPY  LT#TAPE01
 
Requests that #TAPE01 be copied to #TCPY00 and verified; no labels are to be
echoed, and both tapes are to be dismounted upon completion.
 
Example 2 --
 
      !TCOPY  LT#TAPE01#TAPE02
 
Requests that the tapeset #TAPE01#TAPE02 be copied to #TCPY00#TCPY01 and
verified; no labels are to be echoed, and both tapes are to be dismounted upon
completion.
 
Example 3 --
 
      !TCOPY  FT#INTAPE  OVER  FT#COPY  (COPY, PRINT)
 
Requests that the tape #INTAPE be copied to #COPY; no verification is to be
performed, ANS tape labels (if any) are to be echoed on M$LO, and both tapes
are to be dismounted upon completion.
 
Example 4 --
 
      !TCOPY FT#TAPE1#TAPE2 TO MT#COPY1#COPY2 (CPVY, PRINT, SN(NEW))
 
Requests that the tapeset #TAPE1#TAPE2 be copied to #COPY1#COPY2 and verified;
ANS tape labels (if any) are to be echoed on M$LO, the VOLID fields in any VOL1
labels are to be filled with the serial number of the current destination reel,
and both tapes are to be dis- mounted upon completion.
 
Example 5 --
 
      !SET M$EI FT#VOL0#VOL1#VOL2#VOL3#VOL4#VOL5#VOL6#VOL7#VOL8#VOL9
      !SET M$EO FT#VOLA#VOLB#VOLC#VOLD#VOLE#VOLF#VOLG#VOLH#VOLI#VOLJ
      !TCOPY (CPVY, PRINT(CPVY), POS(PTV), SN(CP6)
 
Requests that the M$EI tapeset be copied to the M$EO tapeset and verified; ANS
tape labels are to be echoed on M$LO during copy and verify phases, VOL1 and
FSETID fields are to be filled as per the CP6 standard, and both tapesets are
to be positioned to the beginning of the last volume upon completion.
 
TCOPY_JCL.X is a "canned" JCL stream for doing TCOPY operations; it is intended
primarily for Batch use but may be XEQed Online, as well.
 
   Syntax:
 
      !BATCH TCOPY_JCL.X  [option, . . .]
 
   where options are:
 
      INSN  = 'sn1[#sn2...]'
      OUTSN = 'sn1[#sn2...]'
      OPTS  = 'tcopt[,tcopt]'
 
     and
 
      sn1, sn2, &c. represent tape serial numbers
      tcopt is any valid TCOPY option
 
   Type  ?  for examples of TCOPY_JCL usage.
 
Examples:
 
      !BATCH TCOPY_JCL.X
 
         generates JCL containing:
 
         !TCOPY FT#TCPYIN
 
 
      !BATCH TCOPY_JCL.X  INSN='TAPE01', OUTSN='TAPE02'
 
         generates JCL containing:
 
         !TCOPY  FT#TAPE01  OVER  FT#TAPE02
 
 
      !BATCH TCOPY_JCL.X  INSN='TAPE01#TAPE02', OPTS='PRINT, SN(NEW)'
 
         generates JCL containing:
 
         !TCOPY  FT#TAPE01#TAPE02  (PRINT, SN(NEW))

   TCOPY options are specified on the command line, per standard CP-6 rununit
syntax;  see the rununit command in the Programmer's Reference Manual for a
detailed description of standard syntax.  Options must be enclosed in
parentheses and separated by commas;  e.g.:
 
   !TCOPY  . . .  (opt [, opt . . .] )
 
Descriptions of individual options follow; type ? for each succeeding option,
or type  HELP (TCOPY) OPTIONS option  for a particular option.
   CO/PY         -- Specifies that TCOPY is to duplicate the source
                    (M$EI) tapeset over the destination tapeset (M$EO),
                    subject to any label processing specified by the SN
                    option.
 
   VE/RIFY       -- Specifies that TCOPY is to verify the tapeset on
                    M$EO against the master tapeset on M$EI, flagging
                    any differences in data or tape marks.  Handling
                    of differences in ANS tape label fields VOLID and
                    FSETID will be subject to the SN option specified.
 
   CP/VY         -- Specifies that TCOPY is to perform first the COPY
       -or-         and then the VERIFY operations; each reel of a multi-
   CO/PY,VE/RIFY    volume tapeset will be verified immediately after
                    it is copied, thus requiring that it be mounted
                    but once.  Upon receipt of a verify error the user
                    (if online) will be given the opportunity to
                    re-copy the current reel using a new tape.
                    This is the default.
 
   PR/INT [(mode)] -- Specifies that TCOPY is to list on M$LO any
                      ANS tape labels encountered;  'mode' specifies
                      whether label listing is to occur during COPY,
                      VERIFY, or both (CPVY).  The default, if 'mode'
                      is omitted, is COPY for COPY and CPVY operations,
                      and VERIFY for VERIFY operations.
 
   SN(sub)       -- Specifies that volume identification (VOLID) and
                    file set identification (FSETID) fields in tape
                    labels are to be modified in a manner specified
                    by the given sub-option.  This option is meaningful
                    only for ANS labelled tapes.  Valid sub-options
                    are:
 
                       OLD - No changes made.  VOLID and FSETID are
                             copied from M$EI to M$EO; on verify,
                             these fields must match or an error will
                             be reported.  This is the default if SN
                             is not specified.
 
                       NEW - VOLIDs on new tapeset will be taken from
                             those specified by the user for M$EO, not
                             from M$EI.  On verify, VOLID on M$EO must
                             match the currently mounted serial number.
 
                       CP6 - VOLIDs will be handled as in NEW; FSETIDs
                             in HDR1 labels will be changed to reflect
                             the M$EO VOLID corresponding to the M$EI
                             VOLID under which the file was created.
                             On verify, the same must hold true.
 
   POS (sub)        -- Specifies the dispostion of the tapesets upon
                       exit from TCOPY; valid sub-options are:
 
                       PTL - Position to file marks preceding data
                             sections just closed.
 
                       PTV - Position to beginning of current volumes.
 
                       REL - Remove volumes and release tape drives.
 
                       REM - Remove volumes; if drives were reserved
                             with RES or ORES, the drives remain
                             allocated to the user.
 
                       See the discussion of  POS = OPTION  under
                       M$CLOSE in the Monitor Services Reference
                       manual for further information.

TCOPY requires two tape drives.  In Batch operations, these must be allocated
on the  !RESources  card, as:
 
   !RES MT=2 [, . . . ]
 
If TCOPY is run Online, tape drives will be acquired automatically if they have
not been reserved via the IBEX  !ORES  command; an error will be reported if
fewer than two drives are available.
