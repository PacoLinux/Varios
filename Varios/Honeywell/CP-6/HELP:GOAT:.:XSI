GOAT reports the last time a specified account or account,uname was
successfully logged onto, and the account owner for that logon.
Invocation syntax:
 
 !GOAT.X [acct[,uname]]
 
If the acct,uname is not specified, then the current user's account and uname
are used.
 
If account or account,uname are specified the user must be authorized for
SUPER, SUPERA, or SUPERD pprivs, or FMREAD or FMSEC privileges.
 
Wildcarding of the account is honored if the uname is NOT specified.
 
If a user does not have read access to :USERS.:SYS, either through SUPER
priviledges or file management privs, then the input account information is
ignored and the users JIT.ACCN and JIT.UNAME are used.
 
If an account,uname is specified, GOAT will list the last logged-on time and
account owner for just that account and username.
 
If GOAT can't find any account to match the input, it tells you so.  For help
in setting up the account owner fields for users see the X account tool RAM.
GOAT MUST be run either by a logon user with READ access to the :USERS.:SYS
file, or from .X if the :USERS.:SYS file grants GOAT.X read access.
 
GOAT stands for Get Owner of Account Tool.
