                                BANNER.X
                                --------
 
    The BANNER program is available in the X account on CP-6 for general use,
misuse, and abuse.  Points of interest are:
 
    BANNER is invoked via !BANNER.X (text...).  The entire text to be printed
is enclosed in parentheses and may not contain a close parenthesis (")");
otherwise, any printable ASCII character may appear inside the parentheses.
Some characters have special meanings (see below).
 
    The text is printed in 9-space-high letters on lines of 11 characters each.
BANNER writes via M$LO and does NOT force top-of-form before printing; since
IBEX doesn't force !commands to top-of-form either, you may cause printing over
the fold.  However, if you use BANNER immediately after !JOB/!LIMIT/!RESOURCE,
three lines fit on the !JOB page.
 
    BANNER recognizes two special constructs within the text string, ~TODAY and
~NOW.  The ~TODAY construct is replaced with the ANS form the current date,
YYMMDD, and ~NOW is replaced with the current time, HHMM.  For example, the
command
 
        !BANNER.X (IQP$XREF   ~TODAY ~NOW)
 
    prints two lines in the form
 
        IQP$XREF
        790410 1307
 
The old forms of %TODAY and %NOW are still accepted for compatibility with
pre-B00 systems.
 
    The characters "/" (slash) and "^" (up arrow/circumflex) are interpreted by
BANNER in the following way:
 
    A slash ("/") acts like a carriage return; it is not printed, and text
which follows it is printed on the next "line".  For example, the command
 
        !BANNER.X (IQP$XREF/~TODAY ~NOW)
 
produces the same output as in the example above.
 
    A circumflex ("^") as the FIRST character on a "line" causes BANNER to
print the line at the top of the next printer page, after deleting the
circumflex.  For example, the command
 
        !BANNER.X (^IQP$XREF/~TODAY ~NOW)
 
prints its output at the top of the next printer page, with "IQP$XREF" as the
first line.
