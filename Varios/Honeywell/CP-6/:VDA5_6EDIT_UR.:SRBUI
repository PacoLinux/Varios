       _______       Purpose
 
 
       This Software Release Bulletin (SRB) documents release A05 of the CP-6
       6Edit Processor.  This product operates on Control Program - Six (CP-6)
       software.
 
       The Bull 6Edit product is a screen-oriented file editor.  6Edit can be
       used on most VDU (Visual Display Unit) or CRT terminals for
       interactively editing files containing ASCII text.  In one session, the
       6Edit user can edit any number of files, moving blocks of text between
       them as desired.
 
       6Edit relieves the user of concern with record keys; most editing is
       done by "pointing" the cursor to the text using the cursor control keys,
       terminal function keys, and/or commands.  The user can create names and
       associate them with locations of text in files; thereafter, the user
       need only use the name to refer to the text.
 
       6Edit supports several customizing features.  With these, the user can
       customize the 6Edit environment to a specific terminal and personal

       A05 6Edit requires the E03 (or later) version of the CP-6 operating
       system.
 
       Encoded context files created with previous versions of 6EDIT should
       still be usable with the A05 version.
 
       This version of 6EDIT is year 2000 ready when used in conjunction with
       E05 (or later) versions of the CP-6 operating system.

       Periodically Bull will develop new context files for specific terminals
       or uses.  These may be used as-is by customers, or they may be treated
       as a starting point for customer-developed context files.
 
       The :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK file, as well as each separate :6EDIT_CONTEXT_x
       file contained in the :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK file, are stored on the LADC
       support machine.  They can be found using the fid:
 
           :6EDIT_CONTEXT?.ZZZPATCH
 
       Customers may obtain these files at any time from the support machine.
       From time to time, new context files will be added to the set and will
       be included in the :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK file in .ZZZPATCH.

       __________________________________       Context Files and Customizing CE73
 
 
       The Introduction to 6Edit Screen Editing manual (CE73) is
       "customizable".  It is maintained in FASTEXT source format and can be
       tailored to describe installation-specific 6Edit operating environments.
       Certain 6Edit functions are performed differently on different
       terminals.  A 6Edit "context file" specifies how to invoke these
       functions on a particular terminal.  (There may be many different 6Edit
       context files, each appropriate for a specific type of terminal.)
       Therefore, describing how to use these functions depends on the terminal
       and context file being used.
 
       Without any changes, the Introduction to 6Edit manual describes a
       terminal-independent, standard context file which is delivered with the
       product.  There are two situations when this is not appropriate:
 
       1.  Delivered with the product, in :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK, are some context
           files for specific terminals.  In release A05, the context files
           delivered with the product include:
 
           :6EDIT_CONTEXT_DECVT100 for use with Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC)
                                    VT100 terminals.
           :6EDIT_CONTEXT_PCTX364  for use with IBM-compatible Personal
                                    Computers running the PCT terminal
                                    communications program.
           :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7205  for use with Bull (Honeywell) VIP7205
                                    terminals.
           :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7303  for use with Bull (Honeywell) VIP7303
                                    terminals with the word-processing
                                    keyboard.
           :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7801  for use with Bull (Honeywell) VIP7801 or
                                    VIP7802 terminals.
           :6EDIT_CONTEXT_ZENZ19   for use with Zenith Z19 terminals.
 
           The system manager may want to customize the CE73 document for one
           of these context files.  As part of the installation of 6Edit,
           description files are built for each of the above context files.
           The document can be customized for one of them by supplying the
           appropriate description file to the TEXT processor as it formats the
           document.

       2.  If the system manager creates new 6Edit context files for different
           terminals (or changes the standard 6Edit context file), the manual
           may be customized for the new context file.  This is done by first
           building a description of the new context file, and supplying this
           file to the TEXT processor as it formats the document.
 
       For a full description, see Section 5, Installation Procedures, under
       the subsection "Customizing the Introduction to 6Edit Document".

       ______________________       Terminal Function Keys
 
 
       The FEP sometimes will not recognize key sequences which you have
       defined as KEYINs.  (This affects any IMPs in any processor, not just
       6Edit.  However, since most 6Edit users use IMPs/KEYINs heavily, this
       caution is included in the 6Edit SRB.)
 
       If the terminal you are using has any keys which generate 3- or
       4-character sequences when pressed, then you must be careful about
       defining any KEYINs for those 3- or 4-character sequences.  Because of
       the FEP's expanded support of terminal function keys, the FEP now
       recognizes the character sequences generated by all of the terminal's
       keys (as defined in the terminal's profile) whether or not they match
       the introducer sequences the user has established.
 
 
 
       Example:
 
 
       The Bull (Honeywell) VIP7801 terminal has many "function keys" which
       generate several types of character sequences:
 
       <ESC> <somechar> - Most of the function keys generate a simple
           2-character sequence:  the Escape character followed by another
           character.
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_6EDIT                Terminal Function Keys                      4-1
       
 
 
       <ESC> <[> <somechar> - A few of the function keys generate a 3-character
           sequence:  the Escape character, followed by the left bracket
           character, followed by another character.
 
       Therefore, the FEP will try to match any incoming sequence of <ESC>
       <somechar> or <ESC> <[> <somechar> with one of the sequences known to be
       generated by the VIP7801.  This matching is done regardless of the
       user's introducers established via IMP.
 
       Assume the user has defined a few 6Edit KEYINs (the same applies to IMPs
       in IBEX or any other processor):
 
           $INTRO_1 EQ ESC
           $INTRO_2 EQ '%V(15)' "<CNTL-O>
           KEYIN ESC||'[' IS 'This is my esc-[ function'
 
       The user, unaware and/or unconcerned that the VIP7801 uses <ESC> <[> as
       one of its "built-in" introducers, has defined <ESC> <[> as a function
       by itself.  This is perfectly legal, since the user does not intend to
       use any of the VIP7801 keys which generate <ESC> <[> <x>; the user
       intends to type the Escape key and then the left-bracket key in order to
       generate the text:
 
               This is my esc-[ function
 
       However, when the FEP sees the <ESC> <[> sequence typed at the keyboard,
       it assumes that it was generated by one of the VIP7801's keys which
       generate a <ESC> <[> <x> sequence.  The FEP waits patiently for the
       third character of the sequence--and the user wonders why the
       "This is my..." text wasn't generated.
 
       Workaround:  The FEP has one heuristic to help it determine if, on a
       VIP7801, an incoming <ESC> <[> sequence should be treated as a
       "built-in" introducer or should be looked up in the normal IMP tables.
       This heuristic is timing.  If the time between the <ESC> and the <[> is
       very fast, the FEP assumes that one of the terminal's keys generated the
       sequence, and so the FEP waits for the third character of the sequence.
       However, if the time between the <ESC> and the <[> is slower, the FEP
       assumes that the user typed the sequence, and so will not treat it as a
       built-in introducer.  (Note, however, that if the user has explicitly
       set <ESC> <[> as an introducer for any of his/her KEYINs, the FEP will
       treat <ESC> <[> at any speed as an introducer.)
 
       Therefore, on VIP7801's, if you have defined <ESC> <[> as a KEYIN all on
       its own, then you must type it slowly; otherwise the FEP will wait for
       the third character and will not recognize your KEYIN invocation.  The
       same is true for any terminal's "built-in" introducer sequences:  the
       all-but-the-last-character sequences generated by the terminal's keys.

       NOTE:  If this SRB is enclosed with an entire CP-6 system release for a
              new customer, Steps 1-8 of this section should be disregarded,
              and the CP-6 system installation instructions in the CP-6 HOST
              SRB should be followed.  The processors will be installed as part
              of the installation of the entire CP-6 system.
 
              Any processor-specific instructions not contained in the HOST SRB
              are found after Step 8.

       The tape(s) in this package constitute a processor update release of the
       processors shown on the enclosed order form.  The tape(s) enclosed are a
       PCL labeled tape set.  It is assumed that recipients of this tape have
       already installed a running CP-6 system.
 
       For this processor update release, there are some files which must be
       DEFed onto the customer's P.O. tape set in order to allow for future
       patching, and there are some files that need to be copied into accounts
       other than .:SYS.
 
       To install this processor update release tape follow the steps below:
 
       1.   Logon through a timesharing terminal under an account which is
            authorized with PIGC and SPIDERC processor privileges, FMSEC
            privilege, and the use of at least one tape drive in timesharing
            mode.  The installation instruction example JCL assumes that you
            normally perform your DEFs from the account .:SYSGEN.  If the
            accounts .:SRB, .:QUAC and .:DOCUM already exist, it is assumed
            that these accounts are empty (there should be no files in these
            accounts).  If you have not created these accounts, use the
            following commands:
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_6EDIT                   6Edit Update Tape                        5-1
            
 
 
 
                 !PIG
                 *CR DP#SYS.:SYSGEN GR=15000
                 *MADADD #SYS.:SYSGEN
                 *CR DP#SYS.:SRB GR=1000
                 *MADADD #SYS.:SRB
                 *CR DP#SYS.:DOCUM GR=6000
                 *MADADD #SYS.:DOCUM
                 *CR DP#SYS.:QUAC GR=3000
                 *MADADD #SYS.:QUAC
                 *END
 
 
       2.   Now, you should copy your existing processors into the .:SYSGEN
            account with these commands:
 
                 !PRIV ALL
                 !ORES MEM=256
                 !PCL
                 <COPYALL LT#CP6PO1#CP6PO2#CP6PO3 OVER .:SYSGEN
                 <REM LT#CP6PO3
                 <END
 
       3.   Mount the processor update release tape. This tape is a CP-6 PCL
            tape with a label that is PCL01 (possibly PCL02 also). To get the
            new processors (and their associated files) into your DEF account,
            use these commands:
 
                 !PCL
                 <COPYALL LT#PCL01[#PCL02 ...] OVER .:SYSGEN
                 <REM LT#PCL01[#PCL02 ...]
                 <END
 
       4.   Now the Software Release Bulletins (SRBs) and the manuals for
            the new products should be printed.
 
 
            To move the necessary files from the DEF account (.:SYSGEN) into
            the .:SRB and .:DOCUM accounts in preparation for formatting and
            printing, issue the following command:
 
                 !XEQ $XTAPEINSTALL.:SYSGEN SRB=YES,DOCUM=YES
 
            After that job has run, the :SRB and :DOCUM accounts will contain
            the SRBs and manuals (respectively) for this release.
 
            To format the SRBs and manuals for LONG form (8 1/2 by 11), issue
            the following commands:
 
                 !XEQ $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB
                 !XEQ $XCOPYALL_MANUALS.:DOCUM
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_6EDIT                   6Edit Update Tape                        5-2
            
 
 
            The LONG, WIDE, and STDLP forms are created by XEQing $XFORM.  This
            is described in the HOST SRB, Section 5, Installing the Tools Tape.
 
       5.   The remainder of the files must be moved to the appropriate
            accounts.  Products moved into the .:SYS account will have patches
            applied automatically.  To do this, perform the following command:
 
                 !XEQ $XTAPEINSTALL.:SYSGEN SYS=YES[,DELL=YES]
 
            DELL will delete unnecessary files from :SYSGEN.  It is NOT
            recommended that you install these processors with names other than
            their primary names.
 
            If you choose to install these processors with modified RU names
            for parallel testing, you MUST also change the $XRUMORDER file in
            the :SYSGEN account accordingly.
 
            CAUTION: $XRUMORDER MUST be merged into the site's PATCH DECK
            as-is, to insure the proper operation of the AUTOMATIC patch update
            procedures.
 
       6.   A set of patches for these new products is on this processor update
            tape and will be in the file $XRUMORDER.:SYSGEN.  These patches
            should be merged into the site's patch deck (RUM section) prior to
            creating a new P.O. tape set.  You should now be ready to re-DEF a
            full P.O. tape set.  Modify the !DEFAULT lines of the
            $XDEF_FULL.SUPPORT file to provide the proper SITE_ID and SITE_NAME
            and boot density.  When the patches have merged, execute the
            following to create a new P.O. set:
 
                 !BATCH $XDEF_FULL.SUPPORT
 
            Note, by the time you receive and install this tape, you may be
            several weeks behind in patch releases.  Be sure to pick up all
            patches in the succeeding weekly patch files that pertain to these
            products.
 
 
       7.   When the P.O. tape set created as a result of this job is booted,
            the installation of this processor and its associated files will be
            complete.
 
       8.   Two types of tests exist in the :QUAC account, both of which
            perform some form of elementary existence checking.  Tests of the
            first type are named with the prefix ORDR and the suffix SI; these
            check to see that every element of the products you ordered is
            included in your system.  The output from these tests must be
            checked for a STEPCC of 0.  If the STEPCC for any of these tests is
            greater than 0, you are missing some component(s).  The missing
            components will be listed in the line(s) just above the line
            reporting the name of the test and the STEPCC.

            Tests of the second type have names of the form xx_name_GT4.  These
            tests check to see that each of the processors ordered responds
            properly when invoked; in some cases they check the performance of
            basic features.  These, too, should report a STEPCC of 0.
 
            To run the tests --
 
            After installing the new processors, log on to an account which has
            SUPERA and PIGC processor privileges, then execute the following
            job:
 
                 !SET M$LO LP
                 !XEQ $XSETUP.:QUAC
                 !R
 
            Note the first and third commands above are optional.  This job
            creates a few pages of printing and the process will be much faster
            to print the output on a printer versus a console.
 
 
            Keyin ON BA 1 at the system console to permit batch jobs.
 
            When the QUAC tests are finished, you will have a file called
            $RESULTS.:QUACRUN (this file is also copied to the printer at the
            end of all the tests) which consists of lines reporting the ATITLE
            and STEPCC of each test.  All of the STEPCCs should be zero.  After
            testing is complete, use SUPER to remove the testing account:
 
                !SUPER
                CMD*REM :QUACRUN,107TESTING
                CMD*END
 
           Delete all files in the :QUAC account:
 
                !DEL ?.:QUAC
                YES$
 
 
 
       ______________________       Running $6EDIT_INSTALL
 
 
       After installing the processor according to the above procedure, some
       additional steps must be performed to install the data files used by
       6Edit and its manuals.  The file $6EDIT_INSTALL will perform these
       additional steps.  If $6EDIT_INSTALL is not run, or if for any other
       reason these data files are not made available, the 6Edit processor will
       operate correctly and the manuals will print correctly; however, the
       customizations provided in the context files delivered with the product
       (in the file ":6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK") will not be available.

       To run $6EDIT_INSTALL, type the following IBEX command line:
 
           !XEQ $6EDIT_INSTALL.:LIBRARY
 
       $6EDIT_INSTALL performs two functions:
 
       1.  The file ":6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK" contains several 6Edit context files
           for different terminals and applications, along with descriptions of
           these context files for customizing the introductory manual.  In
           order to be used by 6Edit, these context files must each reside in a
           separate file.  $6EDIT_INSTALL uses the BOOKCHAP.X tool to "split
           up" the :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK file to create the individual files.
           The context files created are named:
 
               :6EDIT_CONTEXT?.:LIBRARY
 
           where the "?" is a string specifying the terminal profile with which
           the context file was designed to be used.
 
           $6EDIT_INSTALL will replace any existing files in .:LIBRARY whose
           names begin with ":6EDIT_CONTEXT" with new versions of the same
           files from the :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK file.
 
       2.  The Introduction to 6Edit manual, CE73, is designed to be customized
           based on the context file in use.  This is done by building a
           "context description file" for the desired context file.
           $6EDIT_INSTALL creates the context description files for the context
           files delivered with 6EDIT (in :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK).
 
           The context description files are created by rearranging the
           characters in the context files.  The context description files
           created are named:
 
               :6EDIT_CONTEXT?_TEXT.:DOCUM
 
           where the "?" is a string specifying the terminal profile with which
           the context file described was designed to be used.
 
           $6EDIT_INSTALL will replace any existing files in .:DOCUM whose
           names begin with ":6EDIT_CONTEXT" with new versions of the same
           files from the :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK file.

       ____________________________________________       Customizing the Introduction to 6Edit Manual
 
 
                 **********************  NOTE  **********************
 
                 The instructions for customizing the Introduction to
                 6Edit document are contained only in this SRB.  This
                 procedure is not described in any other document at
                 this time.  The source for the Introduction is also
                 maintained in FASTEXT format to make this possible.
 
                 ****************************************************
 
       The 6Edit processor is designed to be customized for each terminal on
       which it is used.  A "standard" 6Edit context file is delivered with the
       product; this creates a terminal-independent 6Edit environment.
       However, it is expected that most installations will want to provide
       6Edit context files which are customized for the particular terminal(s)
       in use at that installation.
 
       The CP-6 Introduction to 6Edit Screen Editing manual (CE73) has been
       written with such customization in mind.  This manual describes the use
       of specific keys on the terminal keyboard; however, which keys perform
       which function is dependent on the 6Edit context file in use.  To
       accomodate this, the manual can be modified by the system manager to
       describe 6Edit use with different context files.  The system manager
       does this by building a file which describes the new context file,
       specifying the association of terminal keys with the functions they
       perform.
 
       As it is delivered, the Introduction to 6Edit Screen Editing document
       describes the use of 6Edit using the standard context file.  You can
       customize the document to describe a different context file:  either one
       of the other context files delivered in :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK or a context
       file built by your installation.
 
       This customization of the introductory manual can be used in two ways:
 
       o   On a one-time basis.  That is, if a site has 50 terminals of brand
           "X" installed and 30 terminals of brand "Y", the system manager may
           want to print 50 copies of (or save a unit record file containing)
           the 6Edit manual customized for the 6Edit context file for the "X"
           terminals, and 30 copies (or a separate unit record file) customized
           for the "Y" terminals.
 
       o   On a demand basis.  If a site supports many different terminals or
           has a wide variety of users, the system manager may want to store as
           a unit record file or print the copies of the 6Edit manual as they
           are requested, customized for the terminals specified in each
           request.

                           the Introduction to 6Edit Manual
       
 
 
       These two distribution methods can both be supported by the
       customization technique employed in the Introduction to 6Edit Screen
       Editing manual.
 
 
 
       ADDING/CHANGING CONTEXT FILE DESCRIPTIONS
 
 
       As delivered, with no changes, the introductory manual describes the
       standard context file.  No "description file" (see below) is needed in
       this case.
 
       To customize the manual for a different context file, you must perform
       two steps:
 
       1.  Build a file describing the context file you are documenting.  The
           $6EDIT_INSTALL XEQ-file will automatically build files describing
           all the context files delivered in :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK.  See
           "Describing a Context File" below for details on how to build a
           description file for a context file you developed.
 
       2.  Modify one line in the manual file, specifying the file from step 1
           which describes the context file you are documenting.
 
           To do this, edit the file
 
               CE73_00.:DOCUM
 
           About 50 records into the file will appear a series of lines:
 
               .*ifi :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7801_TEXT.:DOCUM
               .*ifi :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7205_TEXT.:DOCUM
               .*ifi :6EDIT_CONTEXT_ZENZ19_TEXT.:DOCUM
                     .
                     .
                     .
 
           These lines appear as commentary and are therefore ignored by TEXT
           when formatting the manual.  To customize the manual using a
           particular context description file, simply remove the asterisk (*)
           from the line specifying the context file you are describing.  If
           none of the fids following the "ifi" specify the context description
           file you want to use for this printing of the document, add a line
           specifying the correct fid, with no period-asterisk (.*).
 
           Anytime you print the document, only one of the "ifi" lines for a
           context description file should be "uncommented"; all others should
           have period-asterisks (.*).

                              Context File Descriptions
           
 
 
           For example, :6EDIT_CONTEXT_BOOK contains a context file for VIP7801
           terminals, called :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7801.  $6EDIT_INSTALL will build
           a context description file for this context file, called:
 
               :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7801_TEXT.:DOCUM
 
           To format the introductory manual customized for use with the
           VIP7801 context file, find the line in CE73_00.:DOCUM which reads:
 
               .*ifi :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7801_TEXT.:DOCUM
 
           Then, you would change this line, removing the asterisk:
 
               .ifi :6EDIT_CONTEXT_VIP7801_TEXT.:DOCUM

       DESCRIBING A CONTEXT FILE
 
 
       One of the files produced by the $6EDIT_INSTALL XEQ-file describes the
       standard context file.  This is a good starting point for building your
       own context description file.  Type the following command at the IBEX
       prompt:
 
           !C :6EDIT_CONTEXT_TEXT.:DOCUM TO :6EDIT_CONTEXT_x_TEXT.:DOCUM
 
       where the "x" uniquely identifies the context file you want to describe.
 
       The :6EDIT_CONTEXT_x_TEXT file looks like this:
 
           .srv SUBJECT "standard"
           .srv CONTEXT_FID ":6EDIT_CONTEXT.:DOCUM"
           .srv ADJUST "<CNTL-A>"
           .srv AFTER "<ESC> </>"

           .srv BACKWARD_1 "<CNTL-U>"
           .srv BACKWARD_8 "<ESC> <W>"
                 .
                 .
                 .
 
       To change this into the description of a new context file:
 
       1.  In the SUBJECT line, change the word "standard" to some word or
           phrase which describes the context file you are documenting.  This
           word will be used as in:
 
               This manual discusses keystrokes according to the
               <subject> context file.
 
           For example, if you are documenting a context file specific to Bull
           (Honeywell) VIP7301 terminals, the line should read:
 
               .srv SUBJECT "VIP7301"
 
           Or, if the context file is for the specific use of the
           word-processing department, the line might read:
 
               .srv SUBJECT "word processing"
 
       2.  In the CONTEXT_FID line, give the file name and account where the
           user can find the 6Edit context file you are documenting.
 
           Then, you must change the remaining lines by specifying which
           terminal key performs each of the functions listed.  These ".srv"
           lines assign a string (the characters between the quotation marks
           (")) to the names ADJUST, AFTER, BACKWARD_1, BACKWARD_8, etc.  Each
           line follows the form:
 
               .srv function "<how to invoke>"
 
           where:
 
           function - is the name of a generic function which most 6Edit
           context files should allow the user to perform with just a few
           keystrokes.  The function names are fixed in the manual; you cannot
           change them or add any, even if the context file you are documenting
           defines additional functions.  The function names must be entered in
           upper case.
 
           <how to invoke> - is a string of characters telling the user how to
           invoke the function from the keyboard, when using the 6Edit context
           file you are documenting.  This string of characters is information
           you provide.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_6EDIT               Describing a Context File                    5-9
               
 
 
           The <how to invoke> string should follow these guidelines:
 
           o   Use the actual keycap legends from the keyboard of the terminal
               for which the context file is intended.  Surround keycap legends
               with angle brackets (<>), so they can be discerned as keycap
               legends and not be confused with simple text.
 
           o   Differentiate between instructions to press two keys
               simultaneously vs. pressing two keys in succession.
 
               Simultaneous depression is noted by including both keycap
               legends in the same set of angle brackets, separated with a
               hyphen; e.g., <CNTL-A> instructs the user to hold down the
               <CNTL> key while pressing the <A> key.  As another example,
               <SHIFT-F1> specifies holding down the <SHIFT> key while pressing
               the <F1> key.
 
               Successive depression is noted by listing the keycap legends in
               separate sets of angle brackets, separated with a space
               character; e.g., <ESC> <A> instructs the user to press the <ESC>
               key once, then press the <A> key.
 
           o   If the context file you are documenting does not support a
               particular function, then follow the function name with the keys
               to be typed to perform the equivalent function.  For example, if
               your context file does not define a single key to perform the
               EDIT NEXT function, include in the description file the line:
 
                   .srv EDIT_NEXT "<CNTL-C> EDIT NEXT <RETURN>"
 
               (assuming that <CNTL-C> is the key sequence to move the cursor
               to the command window).
 
               By doing this, even though the context file does not define a
               short key sequence for the function, the description of the
               function in the customized manual will still be readable and
               informative.
 
           o   If the quotation mark (") must appear in the <how to invoke>
               string, you must use the TEXT .TRF control word to translate
               some other character (which is not used anywhere else in the
               manual or in your <how to invoke> strings) into the quotation
               mark.  Refer to the CP-6 TEXT Reference Manual (CE48) for
               further information on the .TRF control word.

       The following paragraphs describe each of the generic function names:
 
 
       SUBJECT
 
       This is not actually a function, but rather an item needed for the 6Edit
       manual itself.  The string following it specifies the purpose of the
       context file which you are documenting.  The string is usually one or
       two words.
 
 
       CONTEXT_FID
 
       This is not actually a function, but rather an item needed for the 6Edit
       manual itself.  The string following it tells the user the fid (file
       identifier) of the context file being documented.  Be sure to include
