ENTERME is a run unit that allows you to make a run unit out of an ADAPT script
file.
To use ENTERME, simply copy ENTERME INTO your compiled dialog script file with
PCL, like so:
 
    !ADAPT MYSCRIPT_SI OVER MYSCRIPT
    !C ENTERME.X INTO SCRIPTFILE
 
Now, instead of saying:
    !ENTER MYSCRIPT
 
You can just say:
    !MYSCRIPT.
 
You can also pass initial commands to the dialog in the same manner as you
would with ENTER.
 
Instead of:
    !ENTER MYSCRIPT FIRSTCMD
or:
    !ENTER MYSCRIPT (FIRSTCMD)
 
You can say:
    !MYSCRIPT. FIRSTCMD
or:
    !MYSCRIPT. (FIRSTCMD)
