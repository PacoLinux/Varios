        9        9             PURPOSE:       To provide a module for console messages from
       10       10                            TRANSACTION PROCESSING.
       11       11             DESCRIPTION:   Console templates for those modules who's
       12       12                            Functional Code Group begins with "Q" reside in
       13       13                            this module.  During the course of an integration,
       14       14                            this module will be INSRECed into OC_MSG_S and
       15       15                            TEMPLATed to make its OU file.  All TEMPLAT OUs
       16       16                            are then concatenated to make :OCMSG.  :OCMSG is
       17       17                            in a form that can be utilized by the KEYIN
       18       18                            ghost.
       19       19             CONVENTION:    When creating new messages, the following rules
       20       20                            must be followed:
       21       21                               1) English phrases must not be substituted.
       22       22
       23       23                               2) Indentation must be similar to that of
       24       24                                  the file OC_OCMSG_C.
       25       25
       26       26                               3) Separate message numbers are to be used
       27       27                                  for ASYNC events, and responses to keyins.
       28       28
       29       29                               4) All separate message numbers in this module
       30       30                                  must have, and use subs (within the specified
       31       31                                  range in OC_SUBS_C).  If more numbers are
       32       32                                  required, an additional range will be assigned.
       33       33                               5) All console messages must be preceeded by a
       34       34                                  message class token, to indicate the "type"
       35       35                                  of message.  Available message class tokens
       36       36                                  are:
       37       37              /C1/        Null class, no text is inserted.  This token indicates

       38       38                          console ghost activity, and responses to operator
       39       39                          keyins that display information.
       40       40
       41       41              /C2/    ->  Two spaces, dash, and a right arrow.  Used to indicate
       42       42                          operator information as a result of a keyin that altered
       43       43                          something, usually sent to consoles by attribute (as
       44       44                          opposed to the null class, which is sent to the originating
       45       45                          console.
       46       46
       47       47              /C3/  --->  No spaces, and starts in column 1.  This token indicates
       48       48                          AVR and mount messages, generally points out required
       49       49                          operator activity.
       50       50
       51       51              /C4/  ****  No spaces, four asterisks.  Points device and AVR errors,
       52       52                          usually requires operator intervation or a keyin.
       53       53
       54       54              /C5/        Four spaces.  User-related information, usually line
       55       55                          connects, job on/off messages and batch submission messages.
       56       56
       57       57              /C6/    >>  Two spaces, and two right arrows.  Denotes operator
       58       58                          communication items such as messages from users, and
       59       59                          M$KEYIN read requests.
       60       60
       61       61              /C7/    **  Two spaces, and two asterisks.  Denotes device status
       62       62                          messages, form mounted messages, tape mounted messages,
       63       63                          and the printer unlock message.
       64       64
       65       65              /C8/    !!  Two spaces, and two bangs.  Used to point out possible
       66       66                          problems, user aborts, system ghost aborts, transaction
       67       67                          processing program aborts, etc.
