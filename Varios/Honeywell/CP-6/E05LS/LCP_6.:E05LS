   12
   13      The LCP-6 system macro library is a file, called LCP_6, which
   14      resides in the :LIBRARY account.  It contains the macros to
   15      generate the FPTs, DCBs, and other user visible structures.
   16      In addition, the file contains the declarations for monitor
   17      service entry points.
   18
   19      This file also contains a series of %EQU statements that the PL-6
   20      programmer may use to initialize and/or test fields in the
   21      structures generated by the macros in the LCP_6 macro library.
   22
   23      All EQUs in this file are of the form G_name_# = value
   24      which matches the options available in the macro
   25      invocation.  For example, the G$ISM1 macro has the following
   26      option:
   27
   28         } M1=(G_ON#='1'B,G_OFF#='0'B,ANY)='1'B
   29
   30      So, in the system file, we find:
   31
   32         } %EQU G_ON#='1'B;
   33         } %EQU G_OFF#='0'B;
