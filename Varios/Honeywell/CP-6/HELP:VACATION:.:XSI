VACATION.X is some batch JCL that can be used to answer new letters in a
mailbox, letting senders know the addressee is on vacation.
Use:
 
!BATCH VACATION.X
 
VACATION will wait until a minute before midnight, then go through your mailbox
and create another batch job that will answer any of your "new" mail, telling
the sender that you are out.  VACATION should be batched from the same account
that you have your :MAIL_CENTRAL file.
However, you may copy VACATION.X from the X account into your account if you
wish to change the default "I'm out" mailgram.  There is commentary in the
VACATION file to help.
When VACATION.X runs, it will batch itself off again deferred to midnight of
the next day.  It will also create and batch another job which will open up
your mailbox (:MAIL_CENTRAL) mark and read all new (previously unread) mail,
then exit.  This job will also create a letter to send to everyone whose mail
was in your mailbox as unexamined.  This letter will have the text:
 ____________________________________________________________________
 Subject: I am on vacation...
 
 This letter is being answered automatically.  I don't know when I'll
 return, but I'll let you know when I do.
