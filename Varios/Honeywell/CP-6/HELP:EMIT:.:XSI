EMIT (Error Messages Into Text) it turns an error message file into the
editable, readable *E* format that EXTRACT needs.
Full command line syntax:
 
!EMIT.X errmsg_file OVER output_file [(MONONLY,FCG=xxx)]
 
where:
 
 errmsg_file is an error message file made by EXTRACT  (M$SI)
 output_file is the place to put the reconstructed *E* text  (M$LO)
 MONONLY indicates that only monitor error messages are to be EMITted.
 FCG=xxx indicates that only messages matching the 1-3 characters supplied
     are to be EMITted.
 
There's nothing very fancy about this tool.  In fact, I can't think of anything
else to say about it....
 
You might want to look at EXTRACT.X for more help on what it thinks this tool
is doing..!
