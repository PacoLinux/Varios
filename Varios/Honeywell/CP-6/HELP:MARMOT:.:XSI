      MARMOT "consumes" memory by the megaword for users with SPCLMM
             and ghost authorization.
Syntax:
 
!MARMOT.X  (option)
 
  Options:
 
  EAT nn MEGAWORDS - Start the MARMOT process until nn megawords
                   - are in use by MARMOT.
 
  STOP - Directs all ghosts running MARMOT to exit
 
  If no options are specified, MARMOT gives a one line summary
  of the number of MARMOT ghosts and the number of pages in use.
 
 
MARMOT is a testing aid. It allocates some specified amount of
memory, forcing things like IO cache up into higher memory. Other
processors (STATS, ELAN, etc.) can then be used to monitor activity
and performance.
 
When MARMOT is invoked with the EAT command, it begins a process of
allocating it's maximum amount of memory, starting another copy of
itself as a ghost, then going to sleep. Each ghost will wake up
ocasionally to see if anyone is telling it to STOP.
 
The number of ghosts started may vary. It will depend on the maximum
memory that the "invoking" account is allowed when in ghost mode and
the total amount of memory requested.
 
To increase the amount of memory MARMOT is EATing, it can be invoked
at any time with new target amount. To decrease the amount, MARMOT
has to be STOPped first, and started again with the new, lower total.

1. MARMOT restarts itself as a ghost under the account from which it
   was invoked. Therefore, the account must have ghost authorization.
 
2. MARMOT may run into CONTROL settings that prevent it from
   allocating the full amount of memory requested (UM(G),MAXMM(G)).
 
3. MARMOT has an internal limit of 1 megaword that it will always
   leave available.
 
4. SPCLMM or EXMM are required.
