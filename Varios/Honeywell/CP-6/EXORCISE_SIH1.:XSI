EXORCISE (EXamine and Obliterate Really Confidential Information before Support
Export) is used to purge possibly classified data from COPIES of CP-6 host dump
files.
.*B*
Command syntax:  !EXORCISE.X
 
Once invoked, EXORCISE prompts with
 
   Dump>>
 
A valid response is of the form BCCC[.account].  For example, X007.SUPPORT
results in the dump :DFC01X007.SUPPORT being scrubbed.  If no account is
entered, :SYSTAC2 is assumed.  A null response, QUIT or END terminates the
program at this point.
 
NOTE: EXORCISE does just that.  It permanently removes interesting data from
dumpfiles.  It is highly recommended that you perform exorcisms on COPIES of
dumpfiles that you've made, just so that in case LADC needs more from a dump
(that is to say, less purged from a dump), you will be able to comply.
.*B*
EXORCISE purges the dump file of
 
  1.  Circular queue data
  2.  FPOOLs for all users
  3.  Instruction segments for all users
  4.  All data segments for all users
 
Additionally, comgroup data pages are purged based on some preliminary
calculations that must be performed prior to invoking the EXORCISE processor
(see HELP for CGDATA).  After the above four items have been cleared the dump
file, EXORCISE prompts for an octal page number(.xxxxxxxxx) of the comgroup
page(s) to be removed.
 
   CG page>>
 
A null response, QUIT or END terminates the cleanup process on the dump.
.*K* CGDATA cgdata CG cg
To determine the octal comgroup page number(s) of page(s) dumped into the ANLZ
dump file that are to be purged by the EXORCISE processor, the following steps
are necessary:
 
1.  ANLZ the dump in question
 
2.  Determine the current comgroup from the last line of REC display
  o  Should be .ctxt-0-0,$LS116
  o  If .0-0-0,$PS0, there are no comgroup pages to delete (i.e., give a null
response to CG page>> prompt
 
3.  From the output that results from the following two commands
 
  CG .ctxt
  DTREE
 
determine the page(s) being addressed for each $ASnn referenced under the
column ADDR@ in the DTREE command.  For example, if under ADDR@ you find that
 .020000/11 is displayed, then this means that we're referencing .20000 in
$AS11.  To determine what page within $AS11 that is enter the command
 
   RESOLVE $AS11->.20000
 
The output of the command includes the following :
 
  Virtual Address: .2330000 (WSQ nn)  Real Address: .20004000
 
To determine the comgroup page to be used as input to the EXORCISE program
shift the virtual address right 10 places.  For example,
  .2330000>>10 = .1154.
