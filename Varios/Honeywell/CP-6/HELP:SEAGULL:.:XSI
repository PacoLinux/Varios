SEAGULL (C General Utility Lemur Library)  is a "Tool Box" type library to keep
commonly used, and useful functions for C.
 
Linking syntax:
     !LINK  ;
        object_units, ;
        and_junk_go_here  ;
        (   "options now"  ;
            UNSAT( SEAGULL.X, ...), ;
            "etc" )
 
C source code syntax:
     #include "SEAGULL:h"          /* Must SRCH(.X, ...) on compile */
 
Still have questions?
     !Help (SEAGULL.X) ReadMe      for more information on this Library
     !Help (SEAGULL.X) Catalog     for more information on Library contents
     !Help (SEAGULL.X) SEAGULL:h   for more information on the Header file
 
SEAGULL is meant to make building new X account tools, written in C, a quicker
process.  It is the hope of the originator of this library that all developers
will contribute new functions to SEAGULL.  That is the key to making it a real
success.  We should have an ocean of reusable code someday (some pun intended).

           borrowed directly from the B00 C compiler accounts.
           The routines within serve as an XUU interface.

   The extractable comments were kept in tact for all the

These are to be considered Guidelines, not "set in concrete" rules.
 
The function names should begin with "sg", then the number of
the SEAGULL source file, followed by the given function name.  This will
follow the CP-6 naming conventions in some fashion, and offer a good
cross reference tool for the library functions.  A double underscore is
also recommeneded; for more unique names, and for consistencies sake.
      ie.   sg1__Error (...)
            sg9__blotto ()
            SG5_PL6_ROUTINE ()
 
If a "nicier" name is desired, one can be #defined in the header file
to get rid of the "fcg" as follows:
      #ifndef  Error
      #define  Error    sg1__Error
      #endif
 
If someone wishes to use the Tool Box, but they don't want to use sg1__Error,
they can "#undef  Error" in their source.  (If they wish to use the word
"Error"; otherwise, they need not bother.)
 
The source files are to contain similar types of functions.  The following
files have been defined thus far:
      SEAGULL_SIc1   ==    message reporting functions
      SEAGULL_SIc2   ==    utility functions (time & date stuff now)
      SEAGULL_SIc3   ==    string manipulation functions
      SEAGULL_SIc4   ==    C interface functions to XUU library services
      SEAGULL_SI65   ==    PL-6 interface routines to XUU library services
      SEAGULL_SIc6   ==    Generic symbol table management functions
      SEAGULL_SIx7   ==    not yet used

This Tool Box was created to save time re-writing, or copying code from old
programs, to do the things we always do.  It also should be a place for some
"neat" functions to be kept for public access, and use.
 
For starters, the Tool Box has several variable argument message facilities.
These are for error messages, warnings, debug statements, verbose info, and
just a plain message.  These may, or may not, be to everyone's liking, but
someone can always add a little bit different function to the library.
 
In addition to messages, there are a few utility functions included.  They
are simple little functions, but may be easy to reuse in some code.
 
When updating the Tool Box, please update the CATALOG topic, along with the
CHANGES topic, of this help file.
 
It would be a big help to everyone that will be using this Tool Box if new
functions are well commented.  Not so much in-line, but with EXTRACTable
type comments.  With a minimum of *D*, and if a new file is made *P*.   These
should have the NAME:, PURPOSE:, and DESCRIPTION: portions filled in.
 
The header file, SEAGULL:h.X, must be included in all source programs that
use the SEAGULL Tool Box.  This is a seperately maintained "tool" of the
X account, and must be updated when things are added to SEAGULL.X.
 
This file basically munge's together all the header files used for the
SEAGULL library into one include file to reside in the X account.
 
Another important item in the header file is the functional prototypes.
And with these, the #define to rename the function to a pleasant format.
Generally, each function should have a prototype statement, and a #define as
a minimum.
 
An alternative to including the SEAGULL:h.X Header file is to place the
necessary prototypes into your own Header file.  You can have your own
#define for renaming that way, or you can choose to use the name as-is.
