KIPPER is a tool that checks two update files to see if their updates collide.
KIPPER stands for 'Kollisions In Plus-Packets Error Reporter'.
 
Full command line syntax:
 
!KIPPER.X update_file1,update_file2
 
where:
 
  update_file1 and update_file2 are two sets of syntactically-correct updates
 
KIPPER makes a temporary update file consisting of updates from both packets
and gives them to KEYUP to check for overlapping.  KIPPER exits with STEPCC=6
if an error is found.

kipper: a name given to the male salmon (or sea trout) during spawning season.
At the approach of the breeding season, the lower jaw of the male salmon
becomes hooked upward with a sharp cartilaginous beak known as the kip, which
is used as a weapon by the fish when two or more fight for the same female.
