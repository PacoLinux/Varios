FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.
.*R*
.*A*
MASCOT or My Automatic Screen COmparision Tool,  allows two files which have
captured TRANSparent writes to a terminal to be compared to each other and have
the different lines be printed out.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!MASCOT.X file1,file2 [OVER ,output_file] [(options)]
 
where:
 
 file1 and file2 are the two files you wish to compare to each other.
 output_file is an optional place to put the output
 
Options are: DSI, and DUI.
.*B*
Here are detailed descriptions of the options and their actions.
 
DSI tells MASCOT to dump all 24 lines of the screen created by file1 before
comparing it to the screen created by file2.
 
DUI tells MASCOT to dump all 24 lines of the screen created by file2 before
comparing it to the screen created by file1.
 
They maybe used together for verification purposes, or you may use one and then
mentally impose the differences found on top of it to obtain what the other
screen.
.*B*
By default, MASCOT, reads each of the files in and places the characters on a
internal screen.  When certain criteria, explained later, are meet, the two
internal screens created from the files are compared.  If there are differences
the differences are printed out through M$LO.  If no differences are found
nothing is printed.  The profile that these files were made with is assumed to
be a VIP7801.(Any idea what kind of terminal I have?).  The ESC sequences found
in the file are interpreted accordingly.  As of now, SCREEN ATTRIBUTES are
ignored.  If you find one that I haven't included in my list to ignore, please
feel free to star it.  Ignoring the first character of a two character escape
sequence, could have detrimental effects on how your screens look when they are
compared.
.*B*
Grounds for determining WHEN to compare.
 
    1.  A Clear Screen escape sequence is found. -- ESC `
.*R*
Compare the screens before data is lost.
 
    2.  A '(CR TO GO)' followed by ERASE LINE -- (CR TO GO) ESC K
.*R*
This is so PAGEHALT -- ESC A -- can be turned on and the screens will be
compared before something scrolls of the screen and is lost.
 
    3.  24 Line feeds without a  (CR TO GO)
 
    4.  For flat files, every 24th line. (not recommended)
 
    5.  VFC character '037'O.
.*R*
This is the VFC character of the TERN.X LOG 'string' command.  This allows a
person using TERN to tell MASCOT to compare the screens when one of the above
events won't work.
 
    6.  End Of File.  for obvious reason.
.*R*
If one file runs out before the other, The remaining portion of the larger file
is dumped.
 
.*B*
No more help is available for MASCOT.  Try the TOPICS.
.*K* WHEN_TO_COMPARE
Grounds for determining WHEN to compare.
 
    1.  A Clear Screen escape sequence is found. -- ESC `
.*R*
Compare the screens now before they are erased and data lost.
 
    2.  A '(CR TO GO)' followed by ERASE LINE -- (CR TO GO) ESC K
.*R*
This is so PAGEHALT -- ESC A -- can be turned on and the screens will be
compared before something scrolls of the screen and is lost.
 
    3.  24 Line feeds without a  (CR TO GO)
 
    4.  For flat files, every 24th line. (not recommended)
 
    5.  VFC character '037'O.
.*R*
This is the VFC character of the TERN.X LOG 'string' command.  This allows a
person using TERN to tell MASCOT to compare the screens when one of the above
events won't work.
 
    6.  End Of File.  for obvious reason.
.*R*
If one file runs out before the other, The remaining portion of the larger file
is dumped.
 
.*K* SCRN_ATRIBUTES
As of now, SCREEN ATTRIBUTES are ignored.  If you find one that I haven't
included in my list to ignore, please feel free to star it.  Ignoring the first
character of a two character escape sequence, could have detrimental effects on
how your screens look when they are compared.
.*K* PROFILES_SUPPORTED
The VIP7801 profile is the only one that is currently supported.  The tests at
LADC, were setup to run underneath this profile and we needed a way to verify
the output from these tests.  Therefore, the haste in getting this done was the
main factor more profiles aren't supported.  As a rule however, only profiles
without 'SCROLLING REGIONS' will be supported.
.*K* OPTIONS
Here are detailed descriptions of the options and their actions.
 
DSI tells MASCOT to dump all 24 lines of the screen created by file1 before
comparing it to the screen created by file2.
 
DUI tells MASCOT to dump all 24 lines of the screen created by file2 before
comparing it to the screen created by file1.
