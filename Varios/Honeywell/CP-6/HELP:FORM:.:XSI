FORM.X prints the most useful information about a form from :FORM.:SYS.
The command syntax is:
 
  !FORM.X [(form-name)]
 
Where form-name can be:
 
        { form-name | ? }
 
? (default)-The question mark will list all the forms in :FORM.:SYS.
form-name[(sub-options)]
     This is the six or less character name which specifies the form you want
to know about.  These names are the same as those listed with the ? option.
The sub-options available are F/ULL, I/MAGE, D/EVICE or L/IMITS.
F/ULL
     specifies that you want as much info about a form as possible.
I/MAGE
     Specifies that for some reason, you want to see the print chain image.

I/MAGE

a graphic form is named, this option will be handled the same as the device
option.
D/EVICE or L/IMITS

device limits command are to be displayed.  If this is a regular line oriented
form, and this option is specified, then the chain image is printed.
