BOOKWORM is a program designed to aid in the preparation of tables of contents
and indexes from TEXT files.
.*B*
!BOOKWORM.X
 
Sorts the files *:TOC and *:INDEX which are created by the FASTEXT macros.  As
each file is sorted, a message is printed.  If the file is not found or is not
suitable for sorting, no messages are printed.

from TEXT files.
.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
05/06/89 JES Open work file with a name so it doesn't use what is in *G.
.*B*
(#37056) 11/20/84
 
Bookworm would abort if a document was assembled without an index.
.*R*
08/06/84
.*R*
Handle 8 bit ascii.
 
The presence of short (garbage) records in the *:INDEX file would previously
cause BOOKWORM to decide that *:INDEX was malformed, and terminate index
sorting without notifying the user.  Garbage records will now simply be
ignored;  index sorting will be permitted to continue.
.*R*
1/18/82
.*R*
Fixed bug which would cause a memory (or other random) fault if an index file
was present and a table-of-contents file wasn't.
.*R*
830105
.*R*
.*R*
Added code to (re)build upper-level index structure of sort file when
necessary, to increase sort throughput and reduce number of disk I/Os.
.*R*
07/07/82
.*R*
This replaces the old BOOKWORM entirely.
