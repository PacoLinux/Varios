ALARMD - Provides alarm clock service to users of ALARM library.
 
.*B*
Usage: !ALARMD
 
ALARMD opens a comgroup and waits for alarm clock requests from users of
the ALARM library.  The requests are UTS values, and are kept in a queue
ordered by value.  When the CP-6 system's clock reaches the value of one
of the pending requests, ALARMD sends a response back to the user.
.*B*
ALARMD creates and manages the comgroup ALARMCG.:SYS, so it is
configured to be run from :SYS.  By changing the source it is possible
to put the comgroup in any account and run ALARMD from any account.  If
this is done, the corresponding change must be made to the ALARM source
too.
 
ALARMD requires no privileges.
.*B*
ALARMD is configured to support up to 10 simultaneous users of its
service.  This can be adjusted by changing the MAXALRM EQU in source.
