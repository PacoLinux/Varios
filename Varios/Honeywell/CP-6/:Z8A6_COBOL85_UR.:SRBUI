       _______________________________       General Description of COBOL-85
 
 
           COBOL is a programming language used throughout the world for
           programming business data processing applications.  The COBOL
           language was developed by a group of computer users and
           manufacturers and the first documentation was distributed in April,
           1960.  Since then, COBOL has undergone many changes and extensions
           resulting from manufacturer experience with COBOL programming for
           computers of many sizes and configurations.  These changes and
           extensions are embodied in this version of the COBOL language termed
           ANSI COBOL (X3.23 SEPT-1985).
 
           The CP6 COBOL-85 product will provide a number of enhancements
           compared to its predecessor.  These enhancements include:
 
               o  Increased performance
               o  Improved ease-of-use
               o  Enhanced programming facilities
               o  Improved IBM coexistence
               o  Customer evolution support
               o  Improved product quality and maintainability
 
 
 
       ________________________________________       COBOL-85 Interface With Systems Software
 
 
           The COBOL-85 relationship with system software is as follows:
 
           o   Compiler executes in both the batch and time sharing modes.
 
           o   Source input is obtained through the monitor's data control
               block (DCB) identified as M$SI.
 
           o   Interface with job control language.
 
           o   Interface with update lines via the monitor DCB M$UI.
 
           o   Place object code on object unit file via the monitor DCB M$OU.
 
           o   Object program interface with the input/output system for
               logical and physical I/O.
 
           o   Places listing information on the system output DCB M$LO.
 
           o   Places diagnostics on the system DCB M$DO.
 
           o   Interface with the Linker.

       __________________       Special Procedures
 
 
           Special procedures for this release:
 
           o   COBOL-74 and COBOL-85 object units cannot be mixed in the same
               run unit
 
           o   COBOL-74 and COBOL-85 have different shared libraries.  By using
               COBOL-85 the COBOL-85 shared library is automatically
               associated.
 
           o   The COBOL-85 SORT/MERGE is contained in the COBOL-85 :ETC
               library.
 
           o   New COBOL-85 SORT features are not available in the stand alone
               SORT.
 
 
 
       ______________________       COBOL-74 Compatibility
 
 
           1.  The COPY and REPLACE compile options are not required.
 
           2.  Conversion replacements are not supported.
 
                         REPLACE NOTE BY ==
                         * ==.
                         REPLACE REMARKS BY ==
                         * ==.
                         REPLACE =='== BY =="==.
 
               However, COBOL-85 supports both single and double quoted
               strings.
 
           3.  Precision in Arithmetic Calculations:  In the DIVIDE and COMPUTE
               statements, any fractional result is maintained and truncation
               occurs only in the move to the resultant field.  In COBOL-74,
               the precision of each intermediate result is determined by the
               two operands involved; that is, division of two binary integers
               yields an integer result.
 
           4.  The ENTER PL6 statement is no longer supported to call a PL6
               routine.  The standard COBOL CALL statement can be used.
               Altreturns from PL6 procedures will cause the ON EXCEPTION
               cluase to be executed, however if no ON EXCEPTION clause is
               provided, a runtime abort procedure will be executed.
 
           5.  New reserved words have been added to the COBOL language which
               could cause old programs to get diagnostics (for example, using
               TEST as a data name).
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_COBOL-85             COBOL-74 Compatibility                      1-3
               
 
 
           6.  The I/O status keys have been expanded.
 
           7.  "USE FOR DEBUGGING" is not supported.  DELTA can be used for
               debugging COBOL programs.
 
           8.  The COBOL-74 option allows for programs to execute as they did
               under the COBOL-74 ANSI Standard.  This option affects the
               following:
 
                   a.  the order of evaluation of subscripts for INSPECT,
                       UNSTRING, STRING, ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, and DIVIDE.
 
                   b.  the order of evaluation in PERFORM VARYING of augmenting
                       identifier-2 and setting identifier-5.
 
                   c.  allows a WRITE of a RELATIVE record in a file opened for
                       I/O.
 
                   d.  DISPLAY of numeric data types (insertion of decimal
                       point).
 
                   e.  DISPLAY VFC character (A vs. a).
 
                   f.  ACCEPT of numeric data types (numeric literal vs. exact
                       internal representation).
 
                   g.  File position indicator.
 
          9.   COBOL-85 flags incorrect separators as fatal errors.  COBOL-74
               flagged them when using the WARN option.  An example of an
               incorrect separator is a comma without a space immediately
               following.  COBOL-85 also flags column format violations when
               using the WARN option.
 
 
 
       ____________________________       COBOL-85 Run-Time Facilities
 
 
           COBOL-85 object programs are executed in conjunction with run-time
           support packages which provide the following COBOL-85 run-time
           facilities:
 
               o  File Input/Output facility.
               o  SORT/MERGE facility.
               o  Debugging using the multi-lingual debugger DELTA.
               o  Inter-Program Communication facility.  (CALL/CANCEL)
 
           Run-time interfaces with COBOL-85 objects have been significantly
           reduced.  That is, in concert with execution performance
           improvements more inline code bursts are generated resulting in less
           run-time calls.

       NOTE:  If this SRB is enclosed with an entire CP-6 system release for a
              new customer, Steps 1-8 of this section should be disregarded,
              and the CP-6 system installation instructions in the CP-6 HOST
              SRB should be followed.  The processors will be installed as part
              of the installation of the entire CP-6 system.
 
              Any processor-specific instructions not contained in the HOST SRB
              are found after Step 8.

       The tape(s) in this package constitute a processor update release of the
       processors shown on the enclosed order form.  The tape(s) enclosed are a
       PCL labeled tape set.  It is assumed that recipients of this tape have
       already installed a running CP-6 system.
 
       For this processor update release, there are some files which must be
       DEFed onto the customer's P.O. tape set in order to allow for future
       patching, and there are some files that need to be copied into accounts
       other than .:SYS.
 
       To install this processor update release tape follow the steps below:
 
       1.   Logon through a timesharing terminal under an account which is
            authorized with PIGC and SPIDERC processor privileges, FMSEC
            privilege, and the use of at least one tape drive in timesharing
            mode.  The installation instruction example JCL assumes that you
            normally perform your DEFs from the account .:SYSGEN.  If the
            accounts .:SRB, .:QUAC and .:DOCUM already exist, it is assumed
            that these accounts are empty (there should be no files in these
            accounts).  If you have not created these accounts, use the
            following commands:

                 *END
 
 
       2.   Now, you should copy your existing processors into the .:SYSGEN
            account with these commands:
 
                 !PRIV ALL
                 !ORES MEM=256
                 !PCL
                 <COPYALL LT#CP6PO1#CP6PO2#CP6PO3 OVER .:SYSGEN
                 <REM LT#CP6PO3
                 <END
 
       3.   Mount the processor update release tape. This tape is a CP-6 PCL
            tape with a label that is PCL01 (possibly PCL02 also). To get the
            new processors (and their associated files) into your DEF account,
            use these commands:
 
                 !PCL
                 <COPYALL LT#PCL01[#PCL02 ...] OVER .:SYSGEN
                 <REM LT#PCL01[#PCL02 ...]
                 <END
 
       4.   Now the Software Release Bulletins (SRBs) and the manuals for
            the new products should be printed.
 
 
            To move the necessary files from the DEF account (.:SYSGEN) into
            the .:SRB and .:DOCUM accounts in preparation for formatting and
            printing, issue the following command:
 
                 !XEQ $XTAPEINSTALL.:SYSGEN SRB=YES,DOCUM=YES
 
            After that job has run, the :SRB and :DOCUM accounts will contain
            the SRBs and manuals (respectively) for this release.
 
            To format the SRBs and manuals for LONG form (8 1/2 by 11), issue
            the following commands:
 
                 !XEQ $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB
                 !XEQ $XCOPYALL_MANUALS.:DOCUM
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_COBOL-85              COBOL-85 Update Tape                       5-2
            
 
 
            The LONG, WIDE, and STDLP forms are created by XEQing $XFORM.  This
            is described in the HOST SRB, Section 5, Installing the Tools Tape.
 
       5.   The remainder of the files must be moved to the appropriate
            accounts.  Products moved into the .:SYS account will have patches
            applied automatically.  To do this, perform the following command:
 
                 !XEQ $XTAPEINSTALL.:SYSGEN SYS=YES[,DELL=YES]
 
            DELL will delete unnecessary files from :SYSGEN.  It is NOT
            recommended that you install these processors with names other than
            their primary names.
 
            If you choose to install these processors with modified RU names
            for parallel testing, you MUST also change the $XRUMORDER file in
            the :SYSGEN account accordingly.
 
            CAUTION: $XRUMORDER MUST be merged into the site's PATCH DECK
            as-is, to insure the proper operation of the AUTOMATIC patch update
            procedures.
 
       6.   A set of patches for these new products is on this processor update
            tape and will be in the file $XRUMORDER.:SYSGEN.  These patches
            should be merged into the site's patch deck (RUM section) prior to
            creating a new P.O. tape set.  You should now be ready to re-DEF a
            full P.O. tape set.  Modify the !DEFAULT lines of the
            $XDEF_FULL.SUPPORT file to provide the proper SITE_ID and SITE_NAME
            and boot density.  When the patches have merged, execute the
            following to create a new P.O. set:
 
                 !BATCH $XDEF_FULL.SUPPORT
 
            Note, by the time you receive and install this tape, you may be
            several weeks behind in patch releases.  Be sure to pick up all
            patches in the succeeding weekly patch files that pertain to these
            products.
 
 
       7.   When the P.O. tape set created as a result of this job is booted,
            the installation of this processor and its associated files will be
            complete.
 
       8.   Two types of tests exist in the :QUAC account, both of which
            perform some form of elementary existence checking.  Tests of the
            first type are named with the prefix ORDR and the suffix SI; these
            check to see that every element of the products you ordered is
            included in your system.  The output from these tests must be
            checked for a STEPCC of 0.  If the STEPCC for any of these tests is
            greater than 0, you are missing some component(s).  The missing
            components will be listed in the line(s) just above the line
            reporting the name of the test and the STEPCC.

            Tests of the second type have names of the form xx_name_GT4.  These
            tests check to see that each of the processors ordered responds
            properly when invoked; in some cases they check the performance of
            basic features.  These, too, should report a STEPCC of 0.
 
            To run the tests --
 
            After installing the new processors, log on to an account which has
            SUPERA and PIGC processor privileges, then execute the following
            job:
 
                 !SET M$LO LP
                 !XEQ $XSETUP.:QUAC
                 !R
 
            Note the first and third commands above are optional.  This job
            creates a few pages of printing and the process will be much faster
            to print the output on a printer versus a console.
 
 
            Keyin ON BA 1 at the system console to permit batch jobs.
 
            When the QUAC tests are finished, you will have a file called
            $RESULTS.:QUACRUN (this file is also copied to the printer at the
            end of all the tests) which consists of lines reporting the ATITLE
            and STEPCC of each test.  All of the STEPCCs should be zero.  After
            testing is complete, use SUPER to remove the testing account:
 
                !SUPER
                CMD*REM :QUACRUN,107TESTING
                CMD*END
 
           Delete all files in the :QUAC account:
 
                !DEL ?.:QUAC
                YES$
