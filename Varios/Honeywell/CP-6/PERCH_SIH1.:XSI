PERCH finds punctuation errors in CAP and TEXT documents.  PERCH only provides
a means of checking punctuation correctness, and does not check proper use of
words.
.*B*
  !PERCH.X fid1 [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO} fid2] [(options)]
 
"fid1"
        Identifies the source file to be checked.
 
"fid2"
        Specifies a output file or listing file in which to place the output.
 
"options"
        Are one or more PERCH options, separated by commas.  Options are:
BLX/LAT='string', CAP/B00={ON|OFF}, SCH/EMA.
.*B*
For a list of options/topics, type:
       HELP(PERCH.X) TOPICS
.*R*
For HELP on a specific option, type:
       HELP(PERCH.X) option
.*K* CAPB00 CAP
CAP[B00] = { ON | OFF }
 
The CAPB00 option alows PERCH to recognize CAPB00 or TEXT commands.  For
further information please consult either the CAP DSL Reference Manual
(HA27-00) or Text Processing Reference Manual.
.*K* BLXLAT BLX TRANSLATE
BLX[LAT] = 'string'
 
Allows the user to have characters treated as if they were blanks, essentially
ignoring them.  For further information type HELP (PERCH.X) EXAMPLES.
.*K* SCHEMA
SCH[EMA]
 
Allows the user to see what PERCH is actually parsing, in effect it outputs the
translated line as opposed to the input line.
.*K* DEFAULTS
OUTPUT   = TO ME
.*B*
CAP[B00] = OFF
.*B*
BLX[LAT] = ''
.*K* EXAMPLES
The following would check the file TEST residing in your own account and echo
the output to the screen.  It would also accept CAPB00 commands as acceptable
input, thereby ignoring any punctuation witin the actual command:
 
            !PERCH.X TEST (CAP=ON)
 
This example checks a file within another account (.:TACCT) and redirects the
output to another file.  This example also shows the syntax of the BLXLAT
command:
 
            !PERCH.X TEST.:TACCT OVER TFILE (BLXLAT='^-%')
.*K* EMBEDDED_COMMANDS
A mechanism exists to allow entire sections of text to bypassed.  The bypass
command must appear in the first or left most column in order to be processed
accordingly.  The syntax for Text and CAP[B00] respectively are:
 .*P* OFF
 \*{*P* OFF}
.*R*
Bypassing continues until command to deactivate bypassing is encountered.  The
deactivating mechanism also must appear in the left most column.  The syntax
for TEXT and CAPB00 respectively are:
 .*P* ON
 \*{*P* ON}
.*R*
PERCH also searches for sequences that are defined within the document.  The
sequences can contain up to 80 characters and not more than 10 can be defined.
Definitions must also be found in the first or left most column in order to be
processed correctly.  The syntax for TEXT and CAPB00 respectively are:
 .*P* 'string'
 \*{*P* 'string'}
.*K* OPTIONS options
HELP is available for the following PERCH options:
