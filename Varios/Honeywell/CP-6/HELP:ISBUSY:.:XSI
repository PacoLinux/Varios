ISBUSY can be used in a command stream to test a file's ability to be used
exclusively, and conditionally continue with the jobstream accordingly.
Full command line syntax:
 
!ISBUSY.X disk_file
 
where:
 
 disk_file is a diskfile fid that is to be tested.
 
STEPCC is set to 1 if ANY M$OPEN error occurs.  You can use the IBEX $FID_EXIST
function if existence of the file is in question.
