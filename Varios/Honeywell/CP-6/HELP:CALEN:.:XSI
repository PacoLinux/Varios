                   Terminates CALEN and returns control to IBEX.
 
   FORMAT:     {FO/RMAT [=] (ON | OFF)}  Default is ON.
 
                   When ON, this command produces a display where
                   two months are displayed side by side.
                   When OFF, months are displayed one after the
                   other in a vertical fashion.
 
   MONTH:  [DI/SPLAY][M/ONTH[=]] {month | seqm | listm | this | next | all}
 
       month = Any month name (e.g. JAN/UARY, MARCH, etc)
               where the first 3 letters are usually required.
               Month can also be a decimal number from 1 to 12.
 
       seqm  = Describes a sequence of months to be displayed.
               (e.g. JAN - JUN or 1 - 6, where - means thru)
 
       listm = Any month/s separated by commas and delimited
               by parenthesis (e.g  (JAN,MAR,DEC) or (1,3,12)).
 
       this  = syntax is TH/IS, It will display the current
               month of the specified year (Refer to YEAR option)
 
       next  = syntax is NE/XT [decimal]. This option will
               display the next month/s of the specified year.
               If the decimal number is such that a month greater
               than DECEMBER is produced, only those months
               up to DECEMBER will be displayed. Default is 1.
 
       all   = syntax is ALL, This command displays the whole year.
               synonymous of YEAR command.

   QUARTER:  [DI/SPLAY] {quartname Q/UARTER | Q/UARTER [=] (quartname|quart)}
 
       quartname = {WI/NTER | SP/RING | SU/MMER | FA/LL}
       quart     = Either 1 or 2 or 3.
 
       NOTE: There are two definitions for quarters.
             A number  indicates calendar quarters,
             quart = 1 meaning from January to April,
             quart = 2 from May to August, and
             quart = 3 from September to December.
             quartname refers to college quarters.
 
SCREEN
   SCHEDULE:  {SCH/EDULE [=] (ON | OFF | ALL)}  Default is OFF.
 
                   When ON, This command will turn the FORMAT option
                   off, then, it will look for the calendar file
                   (:CALENDAR) produced by CALENDAR.X. The date, time,
                   and event will be displayed along with the month/s
                   specified in the other options.
 
                   The ALL option does essentially the same thing
                   ON does, except that the file :CALEN is used
                   instead of :CALENDAR. CALENDAR.X eliminates
                   records from :CALENDAR everytime it is used.
                   (Compacting is accomplished by discarding all the
                   records that have a date and time less than the
                   current date & time. In this way the file
                   :CALENDAR is kept short). CALEN.X makes sure
                   of saving those records in :CALEN. In this
                   way the user may display at one point ALL of
                   the scheduled appointments ever !!!
 
                   If run from a different account than the logon
                   account, the :CALENDAR (or :CALEN) file from the
                   logon account will be used.
 
                   NOTE: If time is 00:00, it will not be displayed.
 
 
   SCREEN:     {SC/REEN [=] (ON | OFF)}  Default is OFF.
 
                   When ON, this option will clear the screen and
                   home the cursor after every command is entered.
 
   SEMESTER: [DI/SPLAY] {semname SE/MESTER | SE/MESTER [=] (semname|sem)}
 
       semname = {SP/RING | SU/MMER | FA/LL}
       sem     = Either 1 or 2
 
       NOTE: There are two different definitions for semesters.
             A number (either 1 or 2) indicates calendar semesters,
             sem = 1 meaning from January to June and
             sem = 2 from July to December.
             semname refers to college semesters.
