FAST2CAP converts FASTEXT macros to CAP macros.
To use FAST2CAP, type:
 
!BASIC FAST2CAP.X
RUN
 
You will be prompted for the name of a FASTEXT file to convert.  The FASTEXT
source file will be replaced by the CAP source file.
In general, the CAP macro format is an extension of the FASTEXT macro format.
What works in FASTEXT works in CAP.  The exceptions to this rule are the names
of the macro files and the character that separates  the fields in the macro.
In FASTEXT, the separator is the semicolon (;) and in CAP the separator is the
backslash (\).  In  addition, CAP  macros can  be entered  in upper  or lower
case (but not in mixed  case).   Also,  many  of the  length restrictions have
increased.  For example,  a table title can  now be  up to  200 characters  or
so  in length, depending on the number and length of the column entries.
The following table provides a map of FASTEXT macros to CAP macros:
    FASTEXT   CAP          Comments
  :ARF      None         Archfile documents remain in FASTEXT.
  :DBG      VA$M_DEBUG   No longer interactive.
  :END      ::TB         No parameters indicate table end.
  :FIG      ::FG         Automatically creates figure numbers.
  :FND      ::FG         No parameters indicate figure end.
  :GCS      ::SB         Can accept 4 subsets, menu driven.
  :HTP      ::HL         No changes.
  :HLP      ::HL         No changes.
  :IDX      ::IX         Supports multiple index entries.
  :L0H      ::CH         Can put section number in macro call.
  :L1H      ::L1         New HELP field, separated from topic.
  :L2H      ::L2         New HELP field, separated from topic.
  :L3H      ::L3         New HELP field, separated from topic.
  :L4H      ::IT         Can be introduced anywhere.
  :L5H      ::L5         Fully supported.
  :L6H      ::L6         Fully supported.
  :MAT      ::TB         No absolute positioning, layered columns.
                         Automatically creates table numbers.
  :MMO      None         Memos continue to use FASTEXT.
  :PFS      None         PFS continue to use FASTEXT.
  :UDS      VA$M_FONT    Undocumented.  Use with caution.
The following table shows the completely new CAP macros and gives a brief
summary of their purpose.  Please see the individual macro descriptions for
more information.
    Macro          Summary of Purpose
  ::L4           True level four head.
  ::L7           Level seven head.
  ::L8           Level eight head.
  ::L9           Level nine head.
  ::RF           Automatic cross-reference.
  ::GR           Include vector graphic.
  ::LS           Create columned list.
  ::TC           Place table of contents.
  ::TT           Create title page.
 
LEVEL 4 HEADS
 
The :L4H macro is replaced by the ::IT macro, not by the ::L4 macro.  ::IT is
used as :L4H was used; ::L4 is a true level four head and fits into the
sequence of ::Ln headings.
 
TABLE COLUMNS
 
The ::TB macro does not support absolute positioning of columns.  Thus the
table call:
 
    ..::TB "Title\Column1\30\Column2"
 
is no longer legal.  It is replaced by:
 
    ..::TB "Title\Column1\#23\Column2"
 
Please note that the CAP conversion program performs this conversion
automatically.  The ::TB macro also supports up to three column heading lines
per column head, and longer table titles.
 
LEVEL HEADINGS
 
The major change in level headings is in the "special" codes for generating
HELP messages.  Previously, there were several reserved codes that sometimes
conflicted with what the user wanted to accomplish.  For example:
 
    ..:L1H "The X Command;X"
 
did not generate a HELP topic, because the "X" was a reserved entry that meant
"do not generate a HELP topic".  In CAP, this problem has been removed by
separating the HELP keyword from the entry.  For example:
   ..::L1 "The X Command\X"
 
generates a topic named "X", while:
 
   ..::L1 "The X Command\\X"
 
does not generate a HELP topic.
 
LEVEL ZERO HEADS
 
Note that the :L0H replacement (::CH) has the section number specified on the
same line.  In other words:
 
   .srv SECTION 1
   ..:L0H "My Title"
 
is now replaced by:
 
   ..::CH "My Title\1"
 
In addition, running footers for processor names can be specified on the ::CH
call.  For example:
 
   ..::CH "My Title\1\The EDIT Processor"
 
prints "The Edit Processor" at the bottom of each page of the section.  The
"Section" designator can also be changed in the ::CH call.  For example, to
create a "Module" rather than a "Section", enter:
 
   ..::CH "Learning by Doing\1.1\\Module"
 
PREFACE BOILERPLATES
 
The "boilerplate" material in the preface is now in a macro called
VA$M_HONEYWELL_COPYRIGHT; duplicate material should be deleted from the "_00"
file.
 
ENDING SECTIONS
 
It is no longer necessary to end a section with a level one head (::L1 "\\X")
and a break page (.BRP).
 
AUTOMATIC FIGURE AND TABLE NUMBERING
 
Figures and tables are now automatically numbered; the figure number should not
be included in the macro call.  Thus:
 
   ..:FIG "Figure 1-2.  My Figure;10"
 
 becomes:
 
   ..::FG "My Figure\10"
 
TWO COLUMN FORMATTED TABLES
 
In a two-column formatted table, the first ::IT must immediately follow the
::TB.
 
Indentations in tables and figures should be avoided.  If they must be used,
then they should be "relative" (.inl +2 rather than .inl 2).  Failure to comply
will result in the autobox feature overwriting some of the figure or table.
 
TABLE OF CONTENTS GENERATION
 
::TC The ::TC macro makes it possible to avoid reformatting a document to
include the table of contents within the document.  ::TC gives an estimated
size of the table of contents which is then used when the output file is
created.  Note that the value on the ::TC macro need only be given when the
table of contents is to appear within parts of the front matter (as with
FASTEXT).  If the table of contents is to appear at the end of the front
matter, a value is not required.
