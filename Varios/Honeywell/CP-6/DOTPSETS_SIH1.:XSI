FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=80)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
DOTPSETS will generate and issue SET commands necessary to run a TPAP
(Transaction Processing Application Program) online as opposed to in TP mode.
.*B*
Invocation syntax:
 
!DOTPSETS.X
 
DOTPSETS will ask the user for the:
  Trader file name?   " default is TRADER_FILE.
  Instance name?      " default is the users logon account
  Entry name?         " default is don't do anything
 
The 'Entry name' refers to the ENTRY name as known by TRADER.
.*B*
Using DOTPSETS is handy in that YOU don't have to remember all the funny
options required to connect to the TP comgroup as a "stranger".  Another
advantage is that since DOTPSETS generates the SET commands from the
information in the specified TRADER file, if there is a file and/or DCB name
misspelled in the TRADER file, DOTPSETS will generate a SET command with the
same misspelling as would have been made in TP mode.
.*B*
DOTPSETS (which is actually an XEQ file with XEQME.X copied into it)
accomplishes its task by using TRADER, EDIT and PCL.  It is very easy to make
it do funny things by giving it non standard input.  So, the owner makes no
appologies for what may happen if you feed it something strange!
 
WARNING:  In order to suppress miscellaneous output from EDIT and PCL, SETs on
    M$DO and M$ME are issued.  IF you interupt the execution of DOTPSETS for
    any reason and cause it to terminate early, it IS advisable to do a
    !R M$DO and !R M$ME as soon as you get back to IBEX.  Otherwise, subsequent
    output by other programs/processors will go to the bit-bucket and/or cause
    things to not work normal.
