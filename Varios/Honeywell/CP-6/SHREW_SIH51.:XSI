.*K* ELF51 WILMA
 
ELF log 51 is assigned to WILMA ghost for logging MICOM600 statistics.
Specialized type codes appropriate to this log file are:
 
       C         - Connect:  Normal Class Selection
       CQ        - Connect:  Line from Busy Queue
       CL        - Connect:  Line-to-Line (Matrix Switching)
       CP        - Connect:  Line-to-Port (Matrix Switching)
       CF        - Connect:  Command Console Initiated
       C1        - Connect:  Symbolic Name Primary Class
       C2        - Connect:  Symbolic Name Secondary Class
       D         - Disconnect: Normal Interface Initiated
       DF        - Disconnect: Command Console Forced
       DT        - Disconnect: No Data Activity (Timeout)
       F1        - Failure:  Due to Unavailable Class
       F2        - Failure:  After Busy, Wait?
       F3        - Failure:  Due to Unauthorized Class
       F4        - Failure:  Due to Unassigned Class
       F5        - Failure:  Due to Wrong Speed Class
       F6        - Failure:  Disconnect during CIP
       F7        - Failure:  Due to SELECTION? Timeout
       F8        - Failure:  Due to Queue Full
       F9        - Failure:  Due to Matrix Failure
       FA        - Failure:  Due to Switch Full
       Q         - Busy Queued: Normal
       Q1        - Busy Queued: Symbolic Name Primary Class
       Q2        - Busy Queued: Symbolic Name Secondary Class
       PW        - Power Up: Warm Start
       PE        - Power Up: Warm Start with Errors
       PC        - Power Up: Cold Start
       LON       - Wilma Logging: On
       LOFF      - Wilma Logging: Off
 
In addition, the keyword ALL will select all type codes, and it is permissable
to specify a numeric type code, with optional text string, for expansion codes
which the WILMA ghost might implement.
 
Selection criteria may be supplied in the REPORT command for ELF log number 51
(FOR clause).  Valid specifications are "L", "P" or "C" followed by a
(possibly wildcarded) decimal number, or just a simple "?" to select any
criteria.  For example,
 
       ELF51: REPORT DETAIL FOR C35   "report only Class 35"
       ELF51: REPORT RAW FOR P9?      "report only for Port 9?"
       ELF51: REPORT RAW FOR X3       "For clause ignored"
 
L? selects records which in some way reference the selected Lines; P? selects
ports and C? selects classes.  ?35 would select anything with 35 as a line,
class or port.
 
Specification of (LOG=51) when invoking SHREW will cause automatic
interpretation as a WILMA ghost error log file.
