THORN is a programme that processes output to make it more readable
under fire.  It is handy for speech and presentation outlines.
 
THORN is written in CP-6 BASIC.
.*B*
 
THORN makes records stick out by striking them multiple times on
the printer.  Records to be highlighted in this way are selected by
looking for a trigger string somewhere in the line.  The user may
select up to ten trigger strings.
 
THORN also allows the output to be single-, double-, or triple-spaced.

Invocation syntax:
 
  !BASIC
  >CLOAD THORN.X
  >RUN

HINTS:
  The following example shows THORN used to highlight a speech outline
  for presentation.
 
  Given the following outline:
         Introduction
           "Our Friend the Frog", slide #1
           joke about frogs!
           outline of material to be covered
             outline, slide #2
             note items not to be covered:!
               mating habits
               TH and company
         Types of frogs
           their family tree, slide #3
           land
           amphibious
           aquatic
 
  Since this is going to guide the user in his speech, the output
  should be clear and uncluttered.  THORN may be used to double-space
  the material.
 
  The presentation involves several slides.  The user may get carried
  away by his subject and fail to stick to the outline.  This could
  cause problems since the slides are already arranged in order and
  loaded in the projector.  THORN may be used to highlight lines that
  contain the trigger word "slide".
 
  Some lines may deserve emphasis, but have no unique keyword that
  can be specified as a trigger.  In this example, such lines are
  punctuated with an exclaimation mark ("!").  The mark is used in
  no other place.  It can then be used as a trigger.
.*B*
 
Note:
  o The user may specify up to ten (10) trigger strings.  The
    presence of any one of the strings in a record will cause it
    to be highlighted.
  o Trigger strings may contain embedded spaces.
  o Testing for trigger strings is case-sensitive.  If you expect
    a trigger string to sometimes be capitalized and sometimes not,
    both forms must be presented to THORN.
  o Hilighting loses its effectiveness if most of the records are
    done that way.  Choose trigger strings carefully.
