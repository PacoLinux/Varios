KEYER is a program to validate, rekey, and fix up plus-card files.
Command line syntax:
 
!KEYER.X input-fid [OVER output-fid] [(options, ...)]
 
input-fid is the input file and is required.  It may be wild-carded (? as the
last character).
 
output-fid is the destination.  If not present, no output file will be created
unless only a specific file is selected (no wildcarding and no END option), in
which case the input file will be over-written.  The NOU option may be used to
prevent any output file from being created.
 
Options are:
 
NR/EKEY - Don't rekey the file.  Default is to rekey.
 
NOU/TPUT - Don't create any output.  This is the default if no output-file is
specified, the input-file is not wild-carded and the END option is not
specified.
 
IN/CR=.nn - Use an increment of .nn between plus cards.  Default is to spread
the updates across the interval.
 
LI/MIT - Put all updates for one packet at keys whose integer part is the same
as that of the plus card.  Default is to spread them across the entire
interval.
 
SE/LECT(opt,...) - Select a portion of the file for rekeying and/or plus-card
fixing.  opt may be any of:
       iii - initials
       n   - single update packet by its first number
       n-m - range of update packets
       NAKED - selects plus cards that have no date, initials or star #
    Default is to select the entire file.
 
VA/LIDATE(opt,..) - Validate those items specified: S/TAR, I/NITIALS, D/ATE or
A/LL.  Default is to validate initials only.
 
NV/ALIDATE - Don't do any validation of plus-card fields.
 
NL/LIMCHECK - Don't complain if any of the updates in a packet have keys
outside of the range of the packet in the source file.
 
C/OMMENT='string' - If any selected plus-card does not have a comment (string
delimited by double quotes), put this string on the card.
 
ST/AR=num - If any validation is being done, and a plus card is found that does
not have a date, initials or star number, put on what is missing.  The date
used is the current date, the star number is specified by this option, and the
initials are specified by the INITIAL command (default is first 3 letters of
account).
 
IN/ITIALS=nnn - See STAR.
 
TXT/STAR(txt,...) - When validating star numbers, the default is to accept any
string of up to 6 characters excluding question mark.  If this option is
specified, then any numeric star number will be accepted, but text star numbers
must match one of the strings specified.  The strings may end in ? for
wild-carding.
 
EN/D [=fid] - Do multiple files.  Start with input-fid from the invocation line
and go to the fid specified here, or to the end of the account if no fid.  This
option is ignored if input-fid is wild-carded.
 
STD=fid - File name of standard file containing list of the file names to use.
The account comes from input-fid.
 
LI/ST=fid - File name of a FUMBLE-created list-file.  When doing multiple
files, the module owner from the list-file will be printed along with the file
name in the error messages.
 
PR/OJ=fid - File of names containing list of the project names. If this option
is specified, then any numeric star number will be accepted, but text star
numbers must match one of the strings specified in the file.

860619 [DEW]
Fixed some bugs w/ un-inited memory and standard files.
840807
Made +END come at 99998.000 to facilitate positioning in packet with EDIT's
AP command.
830713
Added code to support a larger number of projects and to be case-insensitive
about project names. (RHH)

This change was the addtion of OPTION. The new option is PROJ
which is to validate text star numbers.  It is very useful when you have to
validate a lot of project names.
