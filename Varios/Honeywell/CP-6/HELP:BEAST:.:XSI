BEAST is a program that manipulates CP/M diskette images that are
stored as CP-6 keyed files.
 
BEAST is written in CP-6 BASIC.
 
BEAST is given the name of a diskette image file (virtual diskette).
It then decodes the CP/M system of file management and allows the
user to perform a number of PCL-like operations on the CP/M files
contained on the diskette.
 
Supported functions are:
  o COPY from a CP/M file on the "diskette" to a standard CP-6 file.
  o COPY from a standard CP-6 file to a file on the "diskette".
  o DELETE files on the diskette image.
  o UNDELETE files on the diskette image.
  o CLEAN up the directory structure of the CP/M "diskette".
  o CHECK the directory structure of the CP/M "diskette".
  o FILL unused data blocks with 'E5'X.
  o LIST files on the virtual diskette.
  o XCHANGE diskette images.
 
For help with any command, type "HELP (BEAST.X) command".

CHECK verifies the integrity of the directory structure of the
CP/M "diskette".
 
SYNTAX:
  CH[ECK]
 
This command goes through the CP/M file directory and tries to read
every sector that is part of a file (this includes deleted files).
If the sector is not in the diskette image (perhaps due to errors
during the PIGETTE phase), a warning message is displayed.
CLEAN up the directory structure of the CP/M "diskette".
 
SYNTAX:
  CLE[AN]
 
This command goes through the CP/M file directory and blanks out
unused entries.  This makes deleted files go away forever and also
neatens up the directory list.
COPY from a standard CP-6 file to a file on the "diskette".
 
SYNTAX:
  C[OPY] cp6_fid disposition cpm_fid (munge_type)
 
Where
  cp6_fid = the file name (only) of the CP-6 file that is to be the
            source the data.  Note that neither account nor password
            may be specified!
  disposition = ON | TO
  cpm_fid = the complete CP/M file identifier that uniquely indicates
            which CP/M file in the diskette is to be the destination
            of the data.
  munge_type = VERBATIM | TEXT-MUNGE | CORE-DUMP | BLOCKED
 
Additional information on these command parts can be obtained by
typing "HELP (BEAST.X) part".
COPY from a CP/M file on the "diskette" to a standard CP-6 file.
 
SYNTAX:
  C[OPY] cpm_fid disposition cp6_fid (munge_type)
 
Where
  cpm_fid = the complete CP/M file identifier that uniquely indicates
            which CP/M file in the diskette is to be the source of
            the data.
  disposition = ON | TO | INTO | OVER
  cp6_fid = the file name (only) of the CP-6 file that is to receive
            the data.  Note that neither account nor password may be
            specified!
  munge_type = VERBATIM | TEXT-MUNGE | CORE-DUMP | BLOCKED
 
Additional information on these command parts can be obtained by
typing "HELP (BEAST.X) part".
This is the file name (only) of the CP-6 file that is involved in a
COPY operation.  Note that neither account nor password may be
specified since BEAST uses the presence of the dot (".") delimiter
differentiate between CP/M and CP-6 files.
The "cpm_fid" identifies a file that resides in the CP/M file
directory on the diskette image.
 
SYNTAX:
  name.extension[.etc]
 
Where:
  name = the name of the file, up to 8 characters.
  extension = the file type (extension), up to 3 characters.
  etc = additional file identification information only used to
        locate a file on the virtual diskette.  This can be anything
        from the ETC field of the LIST command.

DELETE files on the diskette image.
 
SYNTAX:
  DEL[ETE] cpm_fid
 
Where
  cpm_fid = the complete CP/M file identifier that uniquely indicates
            which CP/M file in the diskette is to be deleted.
 
Additional information on these command parts can be obtained by
typing "HELP (BEAST.X) part".
Diskette_image
 
BEAST manipulates diskette images.  These are exact copies, track for
track and sector for sector, of standard flexible diskettes.  These
copies are also refered to as virtual diskettes.
 
The PIGETTE tool can be used to manipulate physical diskettes.  The
MOVE command allows the user to copy an actual diskette to a diskette
image.  Conversly, diskette images can be MOVEd onto actual diskettes
for use on personal computers.
 
PIGETTE does NOT understand the file structure contained on the
diskette.  To PIGETTE it is just a bunch of binary data.  BEAST DOES
understand what is inside the diskette and allows you to use it.
The disposition specifies what happens in the event that the
destination file for a COPY already exists.
 
Choices for disposition are:
  ON | TO = the file must not exist already.  If it does, an error
            message results.
  INTO = the file may exist already.  If it does, the new data from
         the copy is appended onto the end.
  OVER = the old file, if there was one, is overwritten by the new
         information.
FILL initializes unused data blocks in the diskette image.
 
SYNTAX:
  FIL[L]
 
This command goes through the CP/M file directory and notes which data
data blocks are not in use (not part of any file, deleted or
otherwise).  Unused blocks are overwritten by a "clean" sector
composed entirely of 'E5'X.
 
Note that unused sectors that are part of the last block in a file are
NOT filled.
 
Invocation syntax:
 
  !BASIC
  >WLOAD BEAST.X
  >RUN
 
When BEAST starts up, it will ask you what diskette image (virtual
diskette) you want to use.  After answering, BEAST will list the
diskette directory and prompt for commands.
LIST files on the virtual diskette.
 
SYNTAX:
  L[IST]
 
This command lists the directory of files contained on the CP/M
diskette image.  You get such a list automatically whenever you
switch to a new diskette image.
 
For each file on the "diskette", the following information is
displayed:
  o name
  o extension (file type)
  o number of extents used in the directory to describe the file
  o number of blocks used in the diskette to contain the file
  o number of the first data block for this file
  o etc.
 
The number of extents and the number of the first data block are
mostly useless.
 
The "etc" field contains information that you probably want to know
about, but does not fit elsewhere.  This includes:
  o user number
  o an indication that the file is deleted
  o warning messages if the file directory entry for this file has
    been corrupted
 
The "etc" field also serves as a part of the file identifier to enable
selection between multiple files with the same name and extension.
 
For example, a virtual diskette may contain
  NAME     TYPE    ....  ETC
  HELLO    ASM
  HELLO    ASM           USER=2
  GOODBYE  ASM           *DELETED*
References to GOODBYE.ASM will not find a file since it has been
deleted.  You can copy it anyway by asking for GOODBYE.ASM.*DELETED*
In the same way, HELLO.ASM will alwasy get the first file.  To get
the second file, HELLO.ASM.USER=2 should be used.
 
This version of BEAST is a prototype.  It is slow and in some places
awkward to use.  The code is no gem either, but it works.
 
This particular version of BEAST is configured for a particular type
of virtual diskette:
  o 8-inch
  o Single sided
  o Single density
  o 128-byte sectors
  o tracks 0-77
  o sectors 1-26
These parameters describe the type of physical diskette that went into
PIGETTE to make the virtual diskette.  Since the virtual diskette is
an exact copy of the physical diskette, these parameters matter!
 
Additional WARNING:  the diskette controller used on the CP-6 FEP
places some slightly nonstandard data in the sector headers.  SOME
personal computers will be unable to read diskettes created by
PIGETTE, although PIGETTE will hapily read diskettes from such
systems.  This problem is not isolated to PIGETTE.  These systems will
often fail to read diskettes from other personal computers.  There
are a number of possible solutions.  I suggest that you contact your
local microcomputer users' club for help.  Try mentioning the
"crap in the gap" problem.
 
This particular version of BEAST is configured for a particular type
of CP/M diskette:
  o skew factor of 6
  o 8 sectors per block
  o 16 sectors in directory
These parameters are logical constraints overlaid on the constraints
that were derived from the original physical storage.
 
This format happens to be the standard distribution medium for CP/M
systems as delivered by Digital Research.  It is also the standard
distribution medium for various CP/M user groups including CPMUG,
NOCCC, and SIGM.
The munge type tells BEAST what type of file is being processed so
that various formatting changes may be made.
 
The choices are:
  VERBATIM = The CP-6 file is to contain a number of 128-byte records.
             These records are copied, byte for byte, to or from the
             CP/M file.
  TEXT-MUNGE = The file is full of printable ASCII text.  The CP/M
               side is assumed to have records delimited by <CR><LF>.
               Tabs are every 8 columns.  EOF is indicated by <SUB>.
               The CP-6 side is one record per record.  <TAB> is
               replaced by an appropriate number of spaces.  Normal
               CP-6 EOF is used.
  CORE-DUMP = The file is a CP/M run unit, also known as a COM file.
              On the CP/M side this is a number of 128-byte records
              full of binary.  On CP-6, this is a :HEX file identical
              in structure to those processed by ASMZ80, MSAZ80, and
              BAS_LINK.
  BLOCKED = The file is blocked.  On the CP/M side it consists of a
            number of records of a specified length, placed side by
            side.  On CP-6, this is a normal file with one record
            per record.

UNDELETE files on the diskette image.
 
SYNTAX:
  U[NDEL] cpm_fid
 
Where
  cpm_fid = the complete CP/M file identifier that uniquely indicates
            which CP/M file in the diskette is to be deleted.  Note
            that this must include the "etc" field since BEAST can not
            find deleted files without it.
 
Additional information on these command parts can be obtained by
typing "HELP (BEAST.X) part".
Diskette_image
XCHANGE diskette images.
 
SYNTAX:
  X[CHANGE] cp6_fid
