.*A*                                                                           
FIND may be used to find accounts containing a given file name or prefix.
FIND is invoked as follows:
 
!FIND DP#SETNM/NAME[?].ACCT[?],ACCOUNT_LIST ON,OUTFID[(A)]
 
FIND will search a specified set of accounts for a given file name.
The file name may have a trailing wildcard.  The name of each account
in which the file is found will be printed through M$LO (DCB #4).
If the (A) option is specified then the output from FIND will
include the names of all of the files that were found listed out
the same way that they would be using a PCL list with attributes.
.*B*
 
DP#SETNM, .ACCT and ACCOUNT_LIST are all optional.  If DP#SETNM is
present, the search will be restricted to packset SETNM.  If .ACCT is
present, the search will begin with the specified account rather than
the first account in the MAD.  If .ACCT is terminated by "?" then the
search will cease with the first account that is not a wildcard match
with .ACCT.
 
If ACCOUNT_LIST is present then it is a file containing a list of
accounts to be searched, one account per line in the file.  If "?"
or "?.account" is specified then $$DEVELOPMENT_ACCOUNTS.:C00MSC or
$$DEVELOPMENT_ACCOUNTS.account will be used for the list of accounts.
The account list overrides any .ACCT specified.
 
If BREAK is struck while FIND is searching, the current account will
be displayed.
 
Finally, if the user runs FIND with FMSEC privilege set, he will
see all occurrences of NAME, no matter what access controls are in
effect. If the user runs FIND without FMSEC privilege set, he
will only see those accounts the file's access controls would
normally allow him access.

FIND will now !RELEASE packsets acquired during a FIND (unless you ESC ESC
or CTRL Y out of FIND).  Also corrected a problem that would output
"Access denied" when it really wasn't!
