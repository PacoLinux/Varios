REAP (Routine Entry Analysis Program) is a performance monitoring tool that
complements PMON.  It provides information on the number of procedure/function
calls executed during a program run.  In combination with the timing
information provided by PMON you can speed the detection of "hot spots" in your
code.

REAP is a debugger - usage is:
 
 !UNDER REAP
 !your-run-unit.
 
REAP writes the statistics through the REAP_DATA DCB.  The default file name is
*PM_DATA.
.*B*
Use the PMDISP.X tool to display the data collected by REAP.  Where the PM
utilities collect 1 point for each time interval REAP collects 1 point for each
call to a given procedure, thus, if PMDISP reports 5000 total data points, with
23% in module XYZZY then module XYZZY was called 1150 times (23% of 5000).
 
The PMDISP options for detailed module breakdown are not applicable to REAP
collected data since it always indicates the entry point of the external
procedure.
 
REAP also works on overlaid programs.  You may determine how many calls were to
routines in a given overlay by using the NODE SUMMARY option of PMDISP.
 
REAP only collects information on calls to ENTDEFed procedures.  This means
that REAP won't collect information on calls to internal PL6 procedures
(sorry).
 
Happy Hunting!

.*K* INSTALLATION
To install REAP you must:
 
1) Log on to an account with write access to :SYS, and SPIDERC privilege.
 
2) Copy REAP into :SYS (it has to be there since it is a debugger)
 
 !CA REAP.X OVER .:SYS
 
3) Use SPIDER to install REAP as a debugger:
 
 !SPIDER
 INSTALL REAP,DB FROM REAP.:SYS
 END
 
4) Go and edit your TIGR deck to include REAP as a permanent debugger -
otherwise it falls out off every time you crash or boot.  You may also wish to
put it on your PO tape (but that is optional).
