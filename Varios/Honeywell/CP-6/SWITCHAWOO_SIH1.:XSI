.*A*
SWITCHAWOO generates !SWITCH OUTPUT KEYINs for GOOSE when output files exceed
the "reasonable size" for a WSN.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!SWITCHAWOO.X devtype@wsn TO @outputwsn (SIZE>granules)
 
where:
.*R*
devtype
          is the device-type for which output files are destined
.*R*
wsn
          is the workstation that is to be kept from having large printfiles
outputwsn
          is the workstation that is to receive the large printfiles
.*R*
granules
          specifies the size of the printfiles that will be switched.  NOTE:
The "SIZE" is a PARAMETER, not an OPTION.  If you don't specify it, SWITCHAWOO
will complain.
.*B*
EXAMPLE:
 
!SWITCHAWOO.X LP@UPSTAIRS TO @LOCAL (SIZE>100)
 
says that printfiles destined for LP@UPSTAIRS exceeding 100 granules in size
should be switched to @LOCAL.
.*B*
SWITCHAWOO searches for printfiles matching the specified criteria and generate
(on DCB M$LO) GOOSE !SWITCH OUTPUT keyins that can subsequently be fed to the
GOOSE processor for "execution" in two minutes.  SWITCHAWOO does not call GOOSE
directly.
 
If no printfiles are found that match the specified criteria, SWITCHAWOO exits
with a STEPCC of 1.
 
For an example of how SWITCHAWOO is used at LADC, type:
 
!HELP (SWITCHAWOO.X) SAMPLE_JCL
.*K* SAMPLE_JCL
This is the sample JCL used at LADC to employ SWITCHAWOO's unique talents.
Note that I use IBEX's unique talents to act as a pre-SWITCHAWOO filter.

.*K* APPLICATIONS
The sample SWITCHAWOO JCL is just that...a sample.  SWITCHAWOO can be useful in
many more applications than the one LADC needs.  For example, if you have a
sync WSN that is unmanned starting Friday at 17:00, and doesn't become manned
again until Monday at 08:00, you can use SWITCHAWOO with a SIZE parameter of 0
(zero) two or three times during a weekend to automatically switch any
printouts to LP@LOCAL from that unmanned WSN.
 
Of course, SWITCHAWOO has immediate applications where a 2400-baud async serial
printer is in a busy student area and large printouts are an unmanageable
annoyance.
 
The techniques used in SWITCHAWOO aren't complicated; the code was basically
stolen from WOODPECKER.X anyway.  If you have additional switching criteria, it
shouldn't be that hard to add the additional criteria.
.*K* KNOWN_PROBLEMS
SWITCHAWOO works through GOOSE, so its generated KEYINs must, of necessity, be
placed forward in time.  This can allow a large printfile to get started on the
device in that 61-119 second "window".  Sigh.  I don't know what to do about
that right offhand.  At LADC, if it has time to start on the device, it means
it wasn't busy to start with, so perhaps there's not really a problem with
letting the file start on the device.  That same feeling may not be in effect
for that 2400-baud serial printer, though.  I don't really know what to do
about it right now.
.*K* WHATS_A_SWITCHAWOO
SWITCHAWOO was named after watching Ewmer Fudd cartoons continuouswy for
severwal days.  The name came natuwawy.  "Be vewy, vewy quiet.  We'ah hunting
wabbits.  He he he he he."
