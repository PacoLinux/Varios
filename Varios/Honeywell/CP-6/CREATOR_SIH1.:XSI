FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

CREATOR permits a privileged user (with JIT privilege) to change a file's
CREATOR entry without changing the modification date or requiring the file to
be copied over itself.
.*B*
Command line syntax:
 
      !CREATOR.X fid(acct,uname [IF acct2,uname2])
 
If the optional 'IF acct2,uname2' part is left off, the creator is changed
unconditionally.  If it is included, the creator is only changed if the current
creator matches 'acct2,uname2'.  If it is included and does not match, a
message is printed and STEPCC is set to 2.  CREATOR requires JIT privilege to
run.  'fid' may contain a wildcarded filename.

This program is intended for system managers, and not vanilla users.  Please
