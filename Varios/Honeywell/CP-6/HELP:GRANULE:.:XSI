GRANULE tells you how many granules are: in use, been accessed and modified
since a given date.  This report generator can be used on accounts, packs, or
entire systems.
Command line syntax:     <requires FMR privilege>
 
     !GRANULE.X DP#psn [, DP#psn2 [,..]]
     *mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss.dd
 
 
This tool requires FMREAD to run AND the granules examined should be in
accounts that are ACUP (access update). If non ACUP accounts are scanned then
the granules are reported as being 100% accessed since the specified date.
 
The GRANULE tool prints a report that shows since a given date the granules In
Use, Not Accessed, Modified, %Accessed, %Modified. If more than 1 pack or
account is specified a final grand total of the specified report criteria is
printed. In this manner the user can get an accurate report of just how current
the file system on his machine is.
 
For examples sake assume that the date that the following examples are to be
run with the specified search date of April 1, 1982 If the running account is
to be searched use merely:
 
     !GRANULE.X
     *04/01/82 00:00:00.00
 
Suppose 3 packs: DP#AAA, DP#BBB and DP#ZZZ are to be reported on:
 
     !GRANULE.X DP#AAA,DP#BBB,DP#ZZZ
     *04/01/82 00:00:00.00
 
Accounts can be specified as well as packs.

Fix for star 33268; deleted account detection now works right.

 1) Files that don't have a CODE04 area in the fit are ignored.  This occurs
with stowed inactive files.  Previously an error message was generated for each
such file.
 2) A check to see if the user had FMSEC on was removed.  The user will still
need FMREAD if an entire pack is being looked at.
 3) The header line is now printed out correctly.
 4) If an account had no granules in use the program would die by dividing by
zero.  Account with no granules in use are now left out of the report.
 5) The value zero was printed out as all blanks.  Formatting code which
removes leading zeros was modified to leave a single zero.
