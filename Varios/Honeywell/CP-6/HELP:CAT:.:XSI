labeled tape or a GCOS-3 (master or user) save tape.

Modified CAT so that it used X$WILDFMT correctly.  (#40924)
880920
Modified CAT to utilize the official XUW Library Services.
870709
Added updates per star 32440 and UWEC's Vince Streif.
04/28/86 JES for SJC
Fixed bug that caused occasional loss of front part of records in COBOL source
files.
01/10/86  SBC
Now handles both BCD and ASCII com-decks.  Also fixed bug that would loose
records when a field had a length of 55 characters.
01/13/86  LPH
Changed close so CAT nolonger spaces to the end of the current tape file when a
END command is issued!  Also made the creation date correct for GCOS "user
save" tapes.
12/17/85
Now handles com-decks (which previously would produce 0 record files).
01/25/84
Three bugs were fixed, the first two fixes were suggested in STAR #18596.  1 --
Lost data condition handled by checking ARS# in M$EI
 
2 -- Check for current account > input spec. account disabled
     (This causes entire tape to be searched on wild-card input
      specifications; this is somewhat inefficient, but beats
      the previous behavior in that it will access the files.)
 
3 -- Fixed the "finger" (on errors) to point to the right place.
05/26/83 Installed in LADC X account.

The COPY command is used to copy one or more file from the tape into a single
output file.
Syntax: CA | COPYALL res#sn [/filename] [.account] [(copy_ops)]
                      [TO|ON|OVER|INTO [filename_2] [.account2]]
 
   where:
     res          either FT, XT or GT
     sn           tape serial number
     filename     tape file name (can be wildcarded)
     account      account selection for FSAVE tapes

       D[ENSITY] = (556 | 800 | 1600 | 6250)

     account_2    CP-6 file management account

       TY[PE]   = ty | 'ty'
The COPYALL command is used to copy multiple file from the input tape.  File
sequence numbers (FSN) may be combined with wildcard selection and FSAVE
account selection.  An output file name templet can be used.
Examples:
 
  COPYALL XT#SAVE OVER .SOMEACCT
      Copies all files from a Xerox labeled tape OVER file of the
      same name in account SOMEACCT.
 
  COPYALL XT#04A0.LENGE6PM/?_SI OVER ?_CPV
      Copies the files from account LENGE6PM on FSAVE tape 04A0 that
      end in "_SI" OVER the files in the current working directory.
      File names will be changed during the copy to make them end in
      "_CPV" instead of "_SI".

The END command is used to return control to the command processor, usually
IBEX.

                        FSN(1,2-5,6)
The LIST command will list the files on the tape and include file attributes
such as organization, number of records and assign a file sequence number that
may be referenced in subsequent COPYs.
