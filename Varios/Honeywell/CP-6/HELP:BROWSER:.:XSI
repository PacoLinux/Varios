BROWSER is a tool for casually looking through batabase definitions
using the new ARES Extended Application Program Interface and CURSOR.X
calls.  Data may be queried from the tables, privileges permitting.
To invoke type at the IBEX prompt:
 
!BROWSER.X
 
The first screen will look like this:
 
 
                        Welcome to the database BROWSER!
 
                        The model name to browse==>
 
 
Enter the model name at the prompt.  Bad model names will be cleared.
Just hit <CR> to exit.
 
The next screen is the main Action Menu.  It looks like this:
 
 
                           Action Menu
 
                        0.  Exit the database BROWSER
                        1.  Print BROWSER information
                        2.  List items in the database description
                        3.  Display items in the database description
                        4.  Query data in the database
                        5.  Change the model
 
                        Enter the Action number==>
 
 
 
The First menu item will print some reminder information.
 
The second item will allow the user to retrieve data as if a LIST
command was issued in interactive ARES.
 
The third item will allow the user to retrieve data as if a DISPLAY
command was issued in interactive ARES.
 
The fourth item will allow the user to pick a table from a menu to be
queried, which columns values to be retrieved, and an optional
constraint to be specified.
 
The fifth prompt will only be visible after hitting a 2, 3 or 4.
 
All the following screens are menu-driven and self-explanitory.
 
Remember to hit a <CR> to get you out of any screen.
 
A '0' entered at a 'Hit <CR> for more...' prompt will cancel all
pending output, and return you to the last operative screen.
