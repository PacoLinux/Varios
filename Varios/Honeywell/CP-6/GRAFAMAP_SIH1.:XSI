FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

GRAFAMAP creates a single-page "map of the world", using the data in the
GRAFAMAP_ID.X file.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRAFAMAP.X input_file OVER graphics_file
 
(at the moment, there are several incarnations of GRAFAMAP in .X; GRAFAMAP (for
the laserprinter), GRAFAMAPDEC (for the DECVT125 and DECVT241), GRAFAMAPTEK
(for 4010-compatibles), and GRAFAMAPDMP (for the HIDMP29).  Use the version
that matches the device you are using.)
 
where:
 
input_file     is a file of GRAFAMAP input.  For best results, use
GRAFAMAP_ID.X [DCB is F$10]
 
graphics_file  is the place you want the graphics to go.  DCB is GRAPHICS00.
 
That's all there is, really.  This program is really just an excuse to store
the world map datafile somewhere.
.*B*
GRAFAMAP uses the CP-6 DIGS graphics system, which is a separately priced
product.  If you don't have it, maybe you should!  It's not that expensive.
