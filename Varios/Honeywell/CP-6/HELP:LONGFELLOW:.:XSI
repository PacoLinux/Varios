LONGFELLOW checks FORTRAN programs for identifiers longer than value specified
in LEN=  Statement.  The default is 8 characters.
Invocation syntax:
 
!LONGFELLOW.X fortran_source_file [(LEN=nn)] [{ON|INTO|OVER} ,output_file]
 
Since the C01 and later versions of the FORTRAN processor allows 31-character
identifiers, this program can aid the user in finding identifiers that match
through the first nn (specified in the LEN= statement) characters,
but are not identical in the succeeding characters.
 
A list of all the long identifiers and their source line numbers on which they
appear is generated via the M$LO DCB.  Input is via M$SI DCB.
 
It is highly recommended that the user feed a syntactically valid FORTRAN
program to LONGFELLOW.
