A program for removing files from UNIX(*) tar tapes.
The following documentation was stolen from GNU-tar:
 
 *.all
 *..::L2 "The Standard Format"
 *.brf
A tar tape or file contains a series of records.  Each record contains
RECORDSIZE bytes.  Although this format may be thought of as being on magnetic
tape, other media are often used.
 
Each file archived is represented by a header record which describes the file,
followed by zero or more records which give the contents of the file.  At the
end of the archive file there may be a record filled with binary zeros as an
end-of-file marker.  A reasonable system should write a record of zeros at the
end, but must not assume that such a record exists when reading an archive.
 
The records may be blocked for physical I/O operations.  Each block of N
records (where N is set by the '-b' option to tar) is written with a single
write() operation.  On magnetic tapes, the result of such a write is a single
tape record.  When writing an archive, the last block of records should be
written at the full size, with records after the zero record containing all
zeroes.  When reading an archive, a reasonable system should properly handle an
archive whose last block is shorter than the rest, or which contains garbage
records after a zero record.
 
The header record is defined in C as follows:
