       The AR5.0 release of CP-6 amalgamates many fixes and changes to the
       operating system. AR5.0 is also the first Year 2000 ready release of
       CP-6 and users running past 1999 on any previous release will run a high
       risk of encountering year 2000 related problems. For the purposes of
       this, and any other SRBs released for AR5.0, products that are "Year
       2000 ready" mean that they are capable of correctly identifying,
       manipulating, and performing calculations on dates later than December
       31, 1999, and which have been tested as such, provided they are used in
       accordance with their associated documentation and provided that when
       they are linked up to other components, such components factor in the
       calender date on the same conditions as, and are compatible with such
       products.  The term "Year 2000 ready" is not used as a trademark or a
       trade name of products or services but as a literal expression to define
       a technical status of the product.
 
       Some highlights of this release include the following:
       1)  Most of the AR4.0 patches have been incorporated as source fixes. As
           a result, AR5.0 will begin once again with a small patch deck,
           resulting in quicker tape boots.
       2)  A significant effort has been expended to test for and correct year
           2000 related problems. Various corrections have been made in
           different CP-6 products.
       3)  Various bug fixes corrected only through sources fixes will now be
           available with this release.
       4)  The MIRROR processor is now a standard product with CP-6. MIRROR
           allows disk mirroring to provide greater disk reliability and
           protection from disk hardware failures.
       5)  Some updates have been made to various HELP files, providing
           improvements in documentation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                  Introduction                           1-1
       
 
 
       _______       PURPOSE
 
 
       This Software Release Bulletin (SRB) describes the AR5.0 release of Bull
       HN's Control Program-Six (CP-6) which operates on Bull HN DPS/8, DPS 90,
       and DPS 8000 mainframes.  Included in this SRB are summary descriptions
       of AR5.0 features, hardware requirements, a detailed list of the release
       contents with known problems designated, and a guide to the installation
       of CP-6 on the target hardware.
 
       This document is NOT a comprehensive discussion of CP-6 and the use of
       the various software elements comprising CP-6.  This document serves two
       basic purposes:
 
       1.  To provide enough information in hardcopy format to perform the
           initial boot of a CP-6 system: that is, enough of a boot so that a
           CSO engineer can logon and perform diagnostic tests on the system,
           and that the remainder of the system-supplied documentation (SRBs
           and manuals) can be printed on an IOM-connected lineprinter or a
           unit-record lineprinter on a coupler-connected FEP.
 
       2.  To collate and organize change and improvement information into a
           single source that will be of particular value to a CP-6
           installation manager.  The manual set describing the CP-6 system and
           its components is large, consisting of over 50 books and 14,000
           pages of detailed user information.  This document does not exist as
           a substitute for that documentation; it is intended to serve as a
           concise guide to booting the system and to the contents of this
           particular release.
 
       This is also only the HOST and FEP SRB; as delivered, your release tapes
       may contain other, separately priced, software, each element of which
       will have its own SRB.
 
       You should read this, as well as all other enclosed documentation and
       SRBs CAREFULLY, prior to attempting to boot this software.
 
       This document assumes that the reader has some experience with the CP-6
       system.  If you are unsure about whether or not you are qualified to
       boot these tapes, you should contact your Bull HN CSO Representative
       about providing support while booting the system and study the available
       CP-6 manuals before attempting to boot this software.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                     Purpose                             1-2
       
 
 
       ____________________________       BULL HN'S PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
 
 
       As a system, CP-6 encompasses more than the software loaded into memory
       for execution.  The internal structure of data, particularly in the file
       management subsystem, "belongs" to CP-6 development; it is subject to
       change to effect improvements in performance and function.  The
       right-to-change also applies to the data files built and maintained by
       CP-6 service processors for the purposes of controlling system
       operation, for example, :USERS, :HLP, and :RATES.  System tables such as
       JIT and DCB, as well as information files, e.g., :JOBSTATS and :OCHIST,
       are also subject to change.
 
       CAUTION: The intent of this notice is to caution customers regarding the
       writing of programs which rely on intimate knowledge of CP-6 internal
       data structures; Bull HN DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE UPWARD COMPATIBILITY OF
       SUCH PROGRAMS.
 
 
 
       ____________________________       COMPATIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS
 
 
       The AR5.0 release of CP-6 will not support versions of the Front End
       software previous to AR4.0, or products that are not included as part of
       this release or the AR4.0 release.  Please read Section 7 of this SRB
       before bringing up the AR5.0 release of CP-6 for production use.
 
 
 
 
       ____________       NEW FEATURES
 
 
       The AR5.0 release of CP-6 is primarily a maintenance release. No
       significant new user-visible features have been added to CP-6.
 
       The MIRROR processor, which has previously been available as a
       separately priced product, is now standard with CP-6. Refer to the
       latter portion of section 7 for further details on the MIRROR processor.
 
       A significant effort has been expended to address Year 2000 problems in
       the CP-6 software.  Users anticipating running on or beyond the year
       1999 are strongly advised to verify (and correct) any year 2000 problems
       in their own applications.  Please refer to Appendix E for details
       relating to Year 2000 issues.

           Regardless of the year 2000 readiness of any individual CP-6
       product, users must run on an E05 or later version of the CP-6 host if
       they intend to run beyond year 1999. E05 is the first and only release
       thus far that has been specifically tested with year 2000 in mind. E05
       incorporates fixes to problems specifically related to the Year 2000
       problem.

                                                                      SECTION 3
 
 
                                                        HARDWARE CONSIDERATIONS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       ______________       CENTRAL SYSTEM
 
 
       The E05 release of the CP-6 Host Operating System supports the following
       hardware configurations (with peripherals as described in the
       Configuration Guide, DP37-02 or later):
 
           DPS 8/49C               DPS 8/50C
           DPS 8/20C               DPS 8/52C
           DPS 8/44C               DPS 8/62C
           DPS 8/47C               DPS 8/70C
           DPS 90                  DPS 90 (tandem)
           DPS 8000/81 (single)    DPS 8000/82 (tandem)
           DPS 8000/83 (triple)    DPS 8000/84 (quad)
           DPS 8000/41 (submodel)  DPS 8000/31 (submodel)
 
       There is a known hardware problem on DPS 8/47 and DPS 8/49 CPUs.  The
       problem is that a TCTR instruction (which can be generated by using
       the PL6 SEARCHR intrinsic) cannot use a search table that spans the
       first and second pages of a segment.  The user writing a PL6 program
       must take steps to ensure that such a span does not occur.  Note: this
       problem is not new to E05 but has always existed in the DPS 8 hardware.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                 Central System                          3-1
       
 
 
       ______       DPS 90
 
 
       The CPU of the DPS 90 is referred to as an EPU and an IOM is referred to
       as an IOP in some console messages.
 
       When RELEASING/ASSIGNING channels via MSOS, you should ensure that CP-6
       is not currently using the related logical channels.  This can be
       accomplished using the SYSCON PARTITION command.  A complete cycle of
       releasing/assigning a channel should be done in the following order:
 
       PARTITION channel via SYSCON
       RELEASE channel via MSOS
       ASSIGN channel via MSOS
       RETURN channel via SYSCON
 
       When MSOS takes a channel that is the only path to a subsystem of
       devices, the devices will be partitioned and messages about the devices
       being partitioned are output on the console.
 
 
 
       ________       DPS 8000
 
 
       The IOM of the DPS 8000 is referred to as an IMX.  The DPS 8000 IMX
       requires that the latest coupler, BXFEP05A-006, with firmware revision
       12, be installed in all FEPs connected to it.
 
       There are two controllers available only on the DPS 8000:  URP8601 -
       PR54 controller and URP8600 - card reader/card punch controller.
 
       The following items are not supported on a DPS 8000:  Floating Point
       Systems Array Processor, and PRU1200/PRU1600 printers and their
       free-standing controllers.
 
       Remote console access to the DPS 8000 is allowed via the built-in modem.
       This allows Bull TAC to monitor a customer system and perform T&Ds.  A
       second console must be defined in the TIGR deck to allow this; the
       primary console is normally at 0-30, so this console will reside at
       0-31.  This console should normally be partitioned (STATUS=DOWN) and
       will be returned (via SYSCON) by the operator if TAC requires its use.
       By using this console, TAC can access a system even if the FEP is down.

       ____________       FIPS DEVICES
 
 
       The E05 release supports the following FIPS (Federal Information
       Processing Standards) devices for the DPS 90 and DPS 8000 only.

       ___________________       IPC-IPI MDS DEVICES
 
 
       E05 supports the following IPC-IPI MDS (Intelligent Peripheral
       Controller-Intelligent Peripheral Interface Modular Disk Subsystem)
       devices for the DPS 8000 only:
 
       Model No.       Feature No.     Description
       --------        ----------      -----------------------------
       MSU8082         MSS8080         400MB Disk in MSS8080 cabinet
       MSU8082         MSF8080         400MB disk in MSF8080 cabinet
       MSU8082                         Extra 400MB disk added to
                                       either MSS8080 or MSF8080 cabinet.
       MSU8092         MSS8090         1100MB Disk in MSS8090 cabinet
       MSU8092         MSF8090         1100MB disk in MSF8090 cabinet
       MSU8092                         Extra 1100MB disk added to
                                       either MSS8090 or MSF8090 cabinet.
 
              Note:  Each MSU80x2 Marketing Identifier contains two
              MSU80x2 devices (similar to the way the MSU0501 Marketing
              Identifier contains two MSU0501 devices).  A TIGR
              NAME=...DEV#=.. entry must made for each device (spindle).
 
       The IPC-IPI channel firmware for the MDS devices is IIDK00x0, where x is
       the version of the firmware modules.  The firmware for the IPC-IPI MDS
       devices is contained on the MCA PHX diskette.
 
       NOTE: The IMX firmware revision for MDS disks should be IIDK00H0.  If
       the MDS disks are being used as System disks, the firmware MUST be
       upgraded to this level.  Previous firmware versions contained an error
       which would cause a disk I/O to hang under certain connect-while-busy
       situations.
 
       Loading the CM-3 firmware in the MDS cabinet is accomplished offline by
       using the IMCV loader supplied with the firmware tape. Loading the CM-3
       firmware in the MDS cabinet is accomplished online using the CMLOAD.X
       tool.
 
       The extended status for MDS IO errors is displayed and interpreted by
       ELAN.
 
       See the "CP-6 Operations Reference" manual (CE34) for more information
       on IPC-IPI MDS devices.

       ____________       EURC OPTIONS
 
 
       Three versions of the EURC may be configured in a CP-6 IOM-based system.
       Each version supports a particular configuration of peripheral devices.
       The three versions are:
 
           Model No.       Configuration
           --------        -------------
           URP8011         2 line printers and 2 card devices
           URP8012         2 card devices
           URP8013         2 line printers
 
       The model numbers for the peripheral devices and feature identifiers for
       the line printer print trains are:
 
           Model No. Feature No.    Description
           --------  ----------     ----------
           CRU0501                 500 cpm card reader
           CRU1050                 1050 cpm card reader
           PCU0121                 100 cpm card punch
           PRU0901   See PRU1201   900 lpm Line printer
           PRU1201                 1200 lpm Line printer
                     PRB3500       Same as earlier style PRB0500
                     PRB3513       Same as earlier style PRB0513
                     PRB3524       Same as earlier style PRB0524
                     PRB3600       Same as earlier style PRB0600
 
       Although there are several possible configurations, the TIGR UNIT
       command used to describe an EURC and its devices is simple.  The
       following description of UNIT command parameters uses nomenclature from
       the "CP-6 System Support Reference" manual set (HA20, HA21 and HA22).
 
       The MPC model number (mpcmodel) to be used in the TIGR UNIT command for
       all versions of the EURC is URPEURP.
 
       The device model number (model#) to be used in the TIGR UNIT command for
       card devices is as shown above under Model No.  Note that these are the
       same as the device model numbers specified for earlier unit record MPCs.
 
       The feature number (feature#) used in the TIGR UNIT command to describe
       the print train, should be the appropriate earlier style print train
       number (listed under Description, above), which corresponds to the newer
       type of train installed.  For example, when a PRB3513 print train is
       installed, specify PRB0513 as feature#.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                  EURC Options                           3-5
       
 
 
       After CP-6 is up and running, the SUPER processor may be used to define
       a FORM and specify the print train associated with it.  The CHAIN option
       parameters specified for a form to be printed on an EURC-connected line
       printer should be the appropriate earlier style print train identifier
       corresponding to the type of train installed.  Again, when a PRB00513
       print train is installed, specify CHAIN=513 on the SUPER MODIFY or
       CREATE FORM command.  The SUPER FORM options are shown in the
       publication "CP-6 System Support Reference", HA21.
 
              Note:  For E05, FCO #PHAFBB140 (Rev B) needs to be
              installed in free-standing URC controllers in order to
              work with the firmware included with this release.
 
 
 
       ______________       IPC-UR OPTIONS
 
 
       Two versions of the IPC-UR may be configured on a CP-6 DPS 8000 system.
       Each version supports a particular configuration of peripheral devices.
       The two versions are:
 
           Model No.       Configuration           Firmware
           ---------       ------------------      -----------------------
           URP8600         1 - 2 Card devices      ICRD01xxx
           URP8601         1 - 2 Line printers     IPR541xxx
 
       Only PR54-style printers are supported by the IPC-UR firmware.
       PR71-style printers are not supported on CP-6 DPS 8000 systems.
 
       The correct firmware is chosen for the IPC-UR controllers by specifying
       the OS-type as CP-6 in the IMX configuration.  See the latest IMX SRB
       for additional information.
 
 
 
       _____________       VIRTUAL ARRAY
 
 
       Correct operation of the Virtual Array feature requires the installation
       of a new board ETWCX (which replaces the ETXCX board).  This applies
       only to the DPS 8, models 50C, 52C, 62C, and 70C.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                  Virtual Array                          3-6
       
 
 
       ________       FIRMWARE
 
 
       AR5.0 release tapes contain firmware from the D.6 IFAD.  Previous IFAD
       versions should not be used.  Note that 610 tape MPC firmware requires
       the MPC to be updated at least through FCO PHAOTG190.  The firmware for
       the DPS 90 for E05 is on the IPCMPS D.1. boot tape.
 
       The following is a list of hardware FCOs required for E05:
 
       FCO PHAFFP614 - FCO to MSS8080 devices.  This FCO is corequisite with
                       the 80AR4 product set.
       FCO PHAFFP436 - FCO to FIPS tape drives.
       FCO PHAFXS870 - Replacement chips for all DPS8000 FIPS tape and disk
                       channels.  The new firmware in IMX B.3 will use these
                       replacement chips.
       FCO PHAFBB140 - FCO to update free-standing URC controllers.
       FCO PHAOTG190 - FCO to update MPC firmware.
 
 
 
 
       __________________       FEP HARDWARE SETUP
 
 
 
 
 
       _________________________________       General Configuration Information
 
 
       The Front-End Processor (FEP) has a number of technical requirements
       which are included here for reference purposes.
 
       o   CPU - Level 6/47 and 57, DPS 6/95 and 96, DN8/C, DN 8/20C, or a
           DN8/30C (with the MMPO EPROM flap pulled out of channel
            .1000) running in Long Address Format (LAF).  The DPS 6/95 series
           CPU requires the latest coupler, BXFEP05A-Tab 13.
 
       o   Memory - minimum FEP memory is 768KB.  To run FPL or GRAPHICS, an
           additional 256KB of FEP memory is required PER FEATURE.
 
       o   For remote FEPs (RFEPs), two 5.25" disk drives are required for each
           remote FEP, and at least one 5.25" disk drive is required for a
           local FEP at each site having remote FEPs.
 
       o   MLCP's (Multi-line Communications Processors), now called CIBs
           (Channel Interface Base) - all Channel Interfaces (CIs) on any given
           CIB must be the same type:  ASYNC, SYNC, or HDLC CIs cannot be mixed
           on the same CIB.  CIBs should be ordered (from cabinet top to
           bottom) as follows:  ASYNC, SYNC, HDLC, Broadband SYNC, and

       o   Addressing - The L6/Host coupler address must be X'400' for local
           FEPs; the two diskette addresses must be X'400' and X'480' for
           remote FEPs.  The following are the relative bus slot assignments:
 
               Priority                                      Cabinet Position

                    record peripherals.
 
           o   Host Addressing - The FEP coupler can connect to any available
               Direct Data Channel address on the HOST IOM.
 
           o   Hardware Revision Levels - The FEP has a minimum revision level
               requirement for some components.  The current requirements
               follow.
 
           o   MLCP mother boards (MLC9103).  Boards BMLC001B or BMLC011B must
               be tab 12 or higher to support synchronous communication lines.
               BMLC001C or BMLC011C are satisfactory with any current tab.
 
           o   If you have a certain series of coupler board (DCF6700 -
               BXFEP05A), it must be tab -004 or higher.  Tab -006 is required
               for FEPs connected to a DPS 8000 system.
 
           o   The terminator boards in the FEP must be the following revision
               levels for AR5.0.
 
                    Top Terminator Board          60127916 Tab 2

           o   AR5.0 FEP CPUs require Revision 90 Firmware or higher.
 
           o   The CIP firmware must be revision 12 or higher (according to the
               table below).
 
           o   The following Tab levels or greater are necessary (because they
               contain the Revision 90 firmware).

                  (3) The BICP251B is an old board and will only use the slow CIP.
 
       o   Coupler Switches - The mailbox switch on the Host/L6 coupler board
           must be set to '000'.
 
       The following procedure should be carried out prior to first using the
       FEP, or after Customer Service maintenance activities:
 
           1.  Turn power on by placing the POWER switch in the up position.
 
           2.  Unlock the control panel by turning the PANEL SECURITY SWITCH
               fully clockwise.
 
           3.  Press the red "S" (step) and "CLR" (clear) buttons in that
               order.
 
           4.  For local FEPs, lock the control panel by turning the PANEL
               SECURITY SWITCH fully counterclockwise.  For remote FEPs, load
               the diskette drive unit 0 located at address X'400' with a
               bootable RFEP diskette.  Press "L" (load), press "R" (ready),
               press "E" (execute), wait for QLT tests to complete; press "E"
               (execute) again. Lock the control panel.
 
           5.  Verify that the DC ON, LAF and READY indicators are on, and that
               the CHECK indicator is out.
 
       The FEP is now ready to be connected from the host.
 
       The diskette containing the boot image should remain loaded in remote
       FEPs in drive 0 and a formatted scratch diskette should remain in drive
       1 to be ready for use should a recovery be necessary.
 
       In the event that the FEP hangs up and cannot be booted from the host,
       repeat the above sequence from step 2.  If the FEP can still not be
       booted, a Customer Service Representative should be contacted.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB        General Configuration Information                3-9
       
 
 
       When the host is first booted, all local FEPs defined via TIGR, and all
       remote FEPs defined via NETCON and already booted, will be loaded and
       placed into a running state automatically.
 
       To reboot a FEP from a running CP-6 system, a keyin is entered from a
       communications or system operator's console in the form:
 
           !BOOT FEP {fepnumber|fepname}
 
       where fepnumber is the FEP number from the TIGR deck, or fepname is the
       NETCON assigned FEP name.
 
 
 
       _______________________       Booting Panel-less FEPs
 
 
       Booting a FEP without a panel is really no different than booting a FEP
       with a control panel, except that you use a terminal (probably a VIP7201
       or VIP7300).  The key sequences of the VIP7300 and the VIP7201 are
       listed below, with the resulting boot-related function.

                                                                RELEASE CONTENT
 
 
 
 
 
       The AR5.0 CP-6 release package consists of the document titled "CP-6
       Software Release Bulletin", supporting publications, and several
       magnetic tapes grouped in two sets.
 
       The first tape set, called the P.O. tape set, contains a copy of the
       CP-6 operating system that can be booted, patches currently available,
       and the processors ordered.  Each P.O. tape set is specifically tailored
       to the order placed.  The TIGR deck included on the P.O. tape set is not
       intended to match the user's configuration.  It is a minimal set of
       commands, relying on the AUTOCONFIG command, to provide a system that
       can be booted on any hardware configuration.  Use of this default deck
       will make only a small subset of hardware available to the system and is
       only intended to supply a base on which the full configuration can be
       built.  (See Appendix C for more details about TIGR decks.)
 
       The second tape set, called the tools tape, contains elements of
       separately priced software not included on the P.O. tape set, all
       applicable SRBs and manual supplements, various supported and
       unsupported program tools found useful in the development of CP-6,
       sample SUPER jobs to authorize users and terminal profiles, and an
       assortment of "demonstration programs".  Also included are sample
       definitions of line printer forms, and a set of existence tests (QUAC
       tests) used to ensure that all products ordered have been included in
       the release.
 
 
 
       _____________       P.O. TAPE SET
 
 
       The P.O. tape set consists of the following:
 
       o   AARDVARK, the bootstrap and mini I/O system used to load CP-6 into
           memory.
 
       o   Firmware for the tape, disk, and unit record subsystems.  Firmware
           tapes are also distributed separately by Bull HN's Customer Services
           Organization (CSO).
 
           Revision D.6 firmware is being included with this release.

       o   An executable image of the basic CP-6 monitor.
 
       o   XDELTA, the system debugger and patch processor.
 
       o   TIGR, the Table Initialization and Generation Routine.  TIGR
           constructs tables for the actual hardware running CP-6 and other
           system tables related to installation defined parameters, e.g., the
           total number of users allowed on the system.  A minimal TIGR control
           file is also included which uses the AUTOCONFIG to allow for the
           initial boot of the system.  See Appendix C for more details about
           autoconfiguration (and special instructions for systems not having
           unit-record devices).
 
       o   GHOST1, the system initialization ghost.  GHOST1 reads the system
           ghosts, the service processors, and various control files from the
           P.O. tape set .
 
       o   A set of patches to the CP-6 monitor, FEP, and processors.
 
       o   Processors
 
           Volumes 2, 3 and possibly 4 of the P.O. tape set contain the
           products specifically ordered by the CP-6 customer.  The CP-6
           service processors which come with the CP-6 Operating System Kernel
           are a minimal set designed only to demonstrate the viability of the
           hardware and the functioning of the CP-6 operating system.  Ordering
           the CP-6 Access Methods and the Front End Communications software
           will bring the system up to a level at which useful work can be
           performed.  The exact number of volumes in the P.O. tape set is
           determined by the recording density of the tapes and the number of
           products ordered.
 
           The on-line hardware diagnostic program executive, TOLTS, is
           provided with CP-6; additional software, which is available with a
           maintenance contract with Bull HN Customer Service Division, is
           required to make it operational.  Customer Service Representatives
           are responsible for installing an operational TOLTS system on CP-6.
 
           All of the supported products that may be ordered with the AR5.0
           release of CP-6 are listed in Section 2.

       __________       TOOLS TAPE
 
 
       The CP-6 tools tape is an EFT tape set that must be restored on the
       installation's system before users access the system.  It contains the
       following accounts:
 
       :LIBRARY       contains the include files needed by users to access
                      monitor services and library routines described in the
                      "CP-6 Host Library Services Reference", and the macros
                      and routines required to link SORT/MERGE with user
                      programs.  It is intended that all users have full read
                      access to this account; failure to provide it can lead to
                      trouble later.
 
       :XSI           contains the proprietary source code and JCL to create
                      run units for each of the unsupported utility programs
                      normally found in the X account.  Each of the JCL files
                      in this account is identified by the suffix _CRU (Create
                      Run Unit).  HELP files for each of the utilities in this
                      account provides the documentation for the tools and may
                      be accessed via the system HELP facility (e.g., HELP
                      (A.X)).  All users should have execute access to the X
                      account to take full advantage of the time and labor
                      saving tools contained therein.  Additionally, a number
                      of the X account programs operate best if placed
                      in .:SYS, and should be installed there.

       _______________________       KNOWN E05 PROBLEM AREAS
 
 
       When problems with CP-6 software are encountered, the primary method of
       correction is via patches to the released product.  These problems are
       handled and tracked on a case by case basis and are not described in
       this document.  More serious problems, which by definition cannot be
       patched, are described below.  These problems will be resolved in a
       future release of CP-6.

       ___________________________________       AR5.0 SYSTEM-SUPPLIED DOCUMENTATION
 
 
       All of the documentation is system-supplied (included on the release
       tape set) in formatted unit record (UR) files with the software, making
       the software documentation available with the software as soon as the
       system is booted and the tools tape is restored.
 
       The purpose of system-supplied documentation is to supply information
       about new and changed product features.  The source text is copyrighted
       material and must be treated in accordance with current copyright laws.
 
       Instructions on how to print the system-supplied documentation are
       contained in Section 5, "Beginning Production".  Batch files are
       provided in the :SRB and :DOCUM accounts to print unit record files
       and/or print the documentation on LONG form or CONT8 (STDLP @ 8 lpi).
       The forms are as follows:
 
           LONG - 8 1/2" by 11", 6 lines per inch, no top and bottom margins.
 
           CONT8 - 11" by 8 1/2", 8 lines per inch, with top and bottom
           margins.
 
       The quantity of paper required to print the Software Release Bulletins
       on LONG form is approximately 700 pages for one complete set.  The
       quantity for one complete set of manuals on LONG form or CONT8 is
       approximately 18,000 pages.
 
       The AR5.0 release also contains over 60 system-supplied manuals.  The
       manuals for the products ordered are contained in the :DOCUM account as
       printable unit record files.  The account also contains the JCL
       necessary to create hardcopy of the manuals on a line printer.
 
 
 
       __________________________________________________       New, Revised and Updated Manuals for AR5.0 Release
 
 
       Manuals are usually updated to support maintenance releases of products;
       they contain changes from the last published version of the manual.
 
       However, there are no manual changes for AR5.0, although there are HELP
       file changes (see the section below).

       __________       HELP Files
 
 
       Listed below are the processor HELP files and the manuals from which
       they are derived, if applicable.  (For this purpose, Monitor and Libary
       Services are considered processors.)
 
       Typically, When a manual is revised or updated, the corresponding HELP
       file is also revised or updated. In this AR5.0 release, the HELP files
       only are revised; these are marked with an asterisk (*) below:
 
       The HELP files are all titled "HELP:processor:" and are automatically
       included in :SYS.

              The HELP files for ANLZ, CONTROL, KEYIN, NETCON, PIG, RATES,
              REPLAY, SUPER, SYSCON and VOLINIT have access controls so that
              they can only be read from within the processor that they
              describe.  If user access to processors is correctly controlled,
              unauthorized users will not be able to inappropriately access
              information about the system control processors.
 
 
 
       ________________________________       Software Release Bulletins (SRB)
 
 
       The SRBs are included on the Tools tape.  Each product's SRB is packaged

       This section covers the essential steps necessary to boot a running CP-6
       system from the point of receipt to the point where the
       electronically-supplied documentation can be printed.  It is assumed
       that the person assigned to boot CP-6 has taken the prerequisite CP-6
       training classes detailed in Section 1 of this document.
 
       It may be useful to read this section of the document thoroughly PRIOR
       TO attempting to boot CP-6.  This section is designed to help an already
       experienced CP-6 user boot the system.  Therefore, it is arranged in
       somewhat of a "cookbook" order.  References are made to appendices when
       necessary.  However, every attempt has been made to make this task as
       simple as possible.
 
 
 
       ________________       KNOW YOUR LIMITS
 
 
       If you have never booted a CP-6 system or even seen it done, it is
       recommended that you contact the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or
       your local Customer Service Organization (CSO) office to arrange for a
       specialist to assist you in your initial boot of CP-6.  The CP-6 TAC is
       available to be contracted for on-site installation support. The CP-6
       TAC can be reached at:
 
 
             (800) 285-8008    or
             (602) 862-6500

       _________________       UNPACK YOUR TAPES
 
 
       Your package should include a tape labeled CP6PO1 and one labeled
       CP6PO2.  It may also include tapes labeled CP6PO3 and CP6PO4.  These
       tapes are collectively called "PO" tapes.  They contain the bootable
       version of the CP-6 system and its processors, error message files, and
       help files.
 
       There will also be some tapes called "TOOLS TAPES".  These tapes will be
       labeled CP6T01, CP6T02, and CP6T03.  There may also be a CP6T04, CP6T05
       and CP6T06.  These tapes were created using the CP-6 file maintenance
       processor, called EFT, from a fixed base packset named DP#CP6AR5.
 
 
 
       ___________________       PREPARE YOUR SYSTEM
 
 
       Familiarize yourself with your computer system.  Your Bull HN CSO
       representative will be able to point out the location of several
       important elements, specifically:
 
       a)  the "INITIALIZE" button, or associated console command
 
       b)  the "BOOT" button, or associated console command
 
       c)  the system console
 
           you will have to know if the system console is a "Low Cost Console"
           (LCC) or a "System Control Console" (SCC).  A "system control
           console" is distinguishable by the presence of special-purpose
           buttons marked "REQ" or "REQUEST" and "OPER ERROR".  It is generally
           assumed that the person booting CP-6 has familiarity with entering
           information on the type of CP-6 console in use, as well as its
           editing and correction facilities.
 
       d)  the IOM configuration switches (details are in the subsection
           following this one)
 
       e)  the tape MPC that your bootload channel is connected to
 
       f)  the tape drive numbered "1" connected to that MPC
 
       g)  the system disk or disks.  If you are going to use a "501", MDS or
           FIPS style disk, that's fine.  If you are going to use a "451" style
           disk, you'll need at least two, since CP-6 installation requires
           more room than can be provided by a single 451.
 
       h)  if you can, try to arrange for a copy of the "CP-6 System Support
           Reference" set (HA20, HA21 and HA22).  It may also prove useful to
           have a copy of the CP-6 Programmer Reference (CE40) handy.

       j)  if you have time, see if your CSE can initialize the packs you are
           planning to use prior to booting the system.  This will save time in
           the long run, and will give the CSO representative the chance to
           double-check the disk subsystems.  If working with fresh packs,
           you'll have to first perform a VOLINIT-only boot, covered below.
 
 
 
       ____________________       HARDWARE PREPARATION
 
 
       The hardware should be checked out and prepared by CSO to support CP-6.
       After the checkout is complete, certain switches may have been left in
       the incorrect position to support CP-6.  The following list identifies
       these switches and their proper settings.  (Separate paragraphs
       following this one describe switch settings for the DPS 90 and DPS
       8000.)  Please have a Customer Service Representative verify the
       settings of these switches.

       DPS 90
 
       The only switch setting for the DPS 90 that requires operator attention
       is switch 35 on the IOP panel:
 
           Switch 35 ON  - enables automatic booting
 
           Switch 35 OFF - disables automatic booting
 
       These switch settings are also discussed below.
 
       The subsection "Supporting Documentation" in Section 2 includes a list
       of DPS 90 documents.
 
       A running DPS 90 implies the proper functioning of both the IOP resident
       software (IOPMPS) and the operating system (CP-6).  In order to boot the
       CP-6 operating system, the IOPMPS must be running.
 
       The following discussion does not cover the procedure for booting the
       IOPMPS.  If the IOPMPS has NOT been previously booted with the proper
       configuration, it will be necessary for you to do so in accordance with
       the procedures outlined in the IOP Startup Manual, DY03.
 
       Usually the booting of IOPMPS is followed automatically by the booting
       of CP-6.  (In order for this to occur, switch 35 on the IOP panel must
       be ON.)  When the CP-6 boot does not automatically follow the booting of
       IOPMPS (switch 35 OFF), the procedures described in the section "Booting
       CP-6" should be followed.

       DPS 8000
 
       For a single DPS 8000 system configuration, the switches on the Service
       Processor should be set as follows:
 
           MDI to 2nd SP   - OFF
           Control SP      - ON
           System Autoload - ON
 
       For a tandem, triple and quadruple DPS 8000 system configurations, the
       switches on the control Service Processor panel should be set as
       follows:
 
           MDI to 2nd SP   - ON
           Control SP      - ON
           System Autoload - ON
 
       In the tandem, triple and quadruple configurations, the switches on the
       Non-Control Service Processor panel should be set as follows:
 
           MDI to 2nd SP   - ON
           Control SP      - OFF
           System Autoload - OFF
 
       A running DPS 8000 implies proper functioning of the MCA and SP software
       as well as the CP-6 operating system.  In order to boot the DPS 8000,
       the current SP and MCA configuration files must have been loaded.
 
       The following discussion does not cover the procedure required to load
       the SP and MCA configuration files, which MUST be performed first in
       accordance with the techniques described in DPS 8000 SRBs SA76, SA77,
       and SA78, and also the Service Processor Maintenance Guide, 58096616.
 
       Logical channels for DPS 8000 systems should be defined in the MCA
       configuration file as shown:
 
           Console         - chan 30  (chan 31 used for remote)
              additional cons - 32,34,36

       ____________       BOOTING CP-6
 
 
       This section will take the reader through a step-by-step procedure
       designed to bring a CP-6 system up from scratch.  This will result in a
       "vanilla" system, which will serve as a good base for constructing a
       production environment.  If you are already a CP-6 production site, it
       is advised that you review the sections "Compatibility Considerations"
       in Section 2 and the conversion notes in Section 7 before proceeding
       with the first E05 boot.
 
       New users need only have followed the procedures set forth in this
       document to this point.
 
       If you are booting a DPS 90 or a DPS 8000 system, see the subsection on
       booting that specific system rather than the next subsection ("To Begin
       A CP-6 Boot").
 
       The main points of the discussion below are:
 
       o   Hardware defaults.  Peripherals can be connected to the IOM on many
           different channels and device numbers.  The boot process assumes
           that certain devices are present on certain channels.  If these
           assumptions are true, the process is streamlined; if not,
           interactions with the system are required.
 
       o   Beginning the boot.  Various ways of starting the boot are
           described.
 
       o   Booting.  New users should follow the instructions step by step.
           Current users may modify the instructions to suit their production
           requirements.  However, care should be taken to perform the
           conversion steps.
 
       o   Tools Tape and associated procedures.  Activities and files which
           are not part of the bootload process are described.  These
           procedures will flesh out the bare bones system, which results from
           booting the release P.O. tape set.  New users should again follow
           the instructions step by step.
 
       o   QUAC (quality assurance) Tests.  This step ensures that all software
           products ordered are present in the booted configuration.
 
       o   Building a new P.O. tape set.  The P.O. tape set supplied by Bull HN
           is generic in nature.  It contains default TIGR commands, a default
           M:FEP, and a non-current patch deck.  A new P.O. tape set should be
           built and booted before allowing production.
 
       o   Print SRBs and Manuals.  Much of the documentation supplied with
           CP-6 is available as electronic files shipped with the system
           software to guarantee concurrent availability.  The manuals are not
           required to boot the system, but will be needed to begin configuring
           the system for production.
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                  Booting CP-6                           5-6
       
 
 
       The information presented below is a guide for the initial boot of a
       CP-6 system at a new site, and for booting a new release of CP-6 at an
       existing CP-6 site.  The minimum number of procedures, commands, and
       options are presented here, but the information should be sufficient to
       enable an inexperienced user to bring a CP-6 system up and install the
       software supplied by Bull HN.  To bring the system to the point where it
       is ready for controlled, secure, and efficient operation in a production
       mode requires prior planning, as well as preparation of site specific
       items such as packset management and user authorizations.
 
       The P.O. tape set that comes from Bull HN contains all of the processors
       ordered by the installation, and a set of patches for the Host, FEP, and
       processors.  These patches are not the most current set.  They are,
       instead, a set of patches known to work and help simplify the
       installation process.  The site should acquire the most recent patches
       before beginning production.  See Section 6, "Maintenance", for more
       information on patches.  Also included on the P.O. tape set is a minimal
       set of TIGR control commands.  These TIGR commands contain the
       AUTOCONFIG command and will boot a minimal system with no modifications.
       The system will come up with the set of devices defined to AARDVARK
       during the boot process.  These devices are:
 
            SC01 - System Console #1
            IOM0 - Input-Output Multiplexor #0
            LP01 - Line Printer #1
            CR01 - Card Reader #1
            DC01 - Disk Controller #1
            DP01 - Disk Drive #1
            TC01 - Tape Controller #1
            MT01 - Tape Drive #1
            FEP1 - Front-End Communications Processor #1
 
       All these devices are either "found" by AARDVARK, by querying the
       current SCU and IOM or by using certain recommended defaults.  The
       recommended defaults are listed below.  You can have the system prompt
       you for alterations to this sequence.
 
            Defaults for DPS 8 and DPS 90:
 
            SC01 - found by AARDVARK, but is recommended to be at
                   IOM 0 channel 30
            LP01 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 24 (recommended)
            CR01 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 26 (recommended)
            DC01 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 8-9 (recommended)
            DP01 - defaults to device 1 on DC01 (recommended)
            TC01 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 16-17 (recommended)
            MT01 - defaults to device 1 on TC01 (recommended)
            FEP1 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 33 (recommended)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                  Booting CP-6                           5-7
       
 
 
            Defaults for DPS 8000:
 
            SC01 - found by AARDVARK, but is recommended to be at
                   IOM 0 channel 30
            LP01 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 40 (recommended)
            CR01 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 38 (recommended)
            DC01 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 64-67 (recommended)
            DP01 - defaults to device 1 on DC01 (recommended)
            TC01 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 8-9 (recommended)
            MT01 - defaults to device 1 on TC01 (recommended)
            FEP1 - defaults to IOM 0 channel 46 (recommended)
 
 
       NOTE:  If your system is an ELS with a Toshiba SCU, channel 33 is not a
       valid channel to use for FEPs.
 
       All of the defaults can be changed by using the 'change device defaults'
       option, as documented in the "CP-6 System Support Reference".  There are
       several other commands included in the TIGR deck released.  A copy of
       the entire set of commands is printed in Appendix A.  If you do not have
       any IOM-connected unit record devices (like a line printer), you will
       have to follow the special instructions in Appendix C of this SRB.
 
       Use of the TIGR commands on the release P.O. tape set will result in a
       system which will use only a limited subset of the peripheral or central
       system devices which are available.  TIGR commands that describe the
       full configuration should be placed on the P.O. tape set that will be
       made once the system is up.  The full version of the TIGR deck can be
       punched on cards and read in during the initial boot, if desired.  The
       deck should be preceded by a !TIGR card and followed by a !FIN card.
       NOTE:  The END command should NOT be used.
 
       If a card reader is not available, TIGR commands can be entered manually
       from the console or from a second patch tape.  When entering TIGR
       commands from the console, define only the minimum subset of hardware
       required to boot; i.e., one disk (two disks, if all you have are
       451-type disks), one tape, and one FEP.  Appendix C shows the minimum
       set of TIGR commands required, and discusses special considerations and
       procedures when booting with a minimum configuration, special
       configurations, and the entering of TIGR commands from consoles or a
       second patch tape.  A full set of TIGR commands can be built later with
       EDIT when corrections are much easier.  In most cases the AUTOCONFIG
       deck included on the release P.O. tape set will produce the best results
       until a complete TIGR deck is available.  However, you should reference
       Appendix C for special instructions dealing with autoconfiguration and
       TIGR decks.

       ____________________       TO BEGIN A CP-6 BOOT
 
 
 
       Prepare a TIGR deck or a tape containing TIGR commands, if needed.
       Mount a disk pack on the device intended to hold the CP-6 system area.
       If device 1 is NOT used, it will be necessary to respond 'D' (change
       device defaults) to the 'Change boot options...' question (shown below)
       to inform AARDVARK of the location of the pack containing the CP-6
       system area.  It is also recommended that other disk drives be powered
       down during the boot, especially if they have an older version of DP#SYS
       mounted on them.
 
       Local FEPs should have their QLTs run and their panels locked.  If they
       are running any software, especially a previous release of the CP-6 FEP
       software, your host may crash during the boot.  Running QLTs first will
       always avoid this difficulty.  See Section 3 of this document for more
       details.
 
       The disk pack destined to hold the CP-6 system area may be any of the
       following:
 
       1.  A virgin pack, never before used on any CP-6 system.  However, it
           must first be initialized using the VOLINIT process.  This may be
           accomplished by responding 'VO' to the 'TB/DB/OR/VO?' question.  The
           VOLINIT process is described in the subsection "Physical
           Initialization of Packs Via VOLINIT", and in the boot scenarios in
           the subsection "VOLINIT Execution".
 
       2.  A CP-6 scratch pack.  This pack has been previously SCRATCHed by the
           PIG processor on a running CP-6 system.  The boot process will
           properly initialize the system area.
 
       3.  A CP-6 system pack.  This pack has been used before for the purpose
           of holding the system area.  The boot process will properly
           initialize the system area.
 
       Note: As of AR4.0 Beta Release, there is an outstanding problem in
       building the system packs on a previously built 3-pack set.  If you wish
       to build #SYS on 3 packs, first scratch all 3 packs from PIG. Next
       perform the 'Yes' to new files boot; this builds the system pack on one
       of the packs first.  Once the system is up for the first time, you
       should then use PIG to EXTEND #SYS with the other two packs.  For
       further details on this problem, refer to STAR #41352 in STARLOG.
 
       Note: it is possible for the 'Yes' to new file boot to terminate with
       the error "System area too small - reboot".  This happens for the disk
       packs which have been previously made into more than 1 section and
       occurs when there are more than two sections or when the second section
       section is neither #SYS nor scratched.  To ensure you don't run into
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB              To Begin a CP-6 Boot                       5-9
       
 
 
       this problem, before doing the boot, check that the disk pack contains
       no more than two sections and that the second section is either
       scratched or contains #SYS.  (This is not necessary if a VOLINIT is
       performed on the disk).  Refer to STAR #41962 in STARLOG for further
       information.
 
       Set the boot unit address switches in the tape MPC; use device 1 to take
       advantage of the boot defaults.  These switches are located behind the
       panel on top of the tape MPC.  Switches 4-7 in the block labeled
       CONFIGURATION form a binary input for the boot tape handler device
       number with switch 7 as the low-order bit.  To set up for device number
       1, set switch 7.  On this device, UP is SET (ON), and DOWN is RESET
       (OFF).
 
       Mount the first volume of the P.O. tape set on the device selected
       above.  Again, if device 1 on the default channel is not used as the
       boot device you must enter 'D' in response to the question 'Change boot
       options...' during the boot process.
 
       Place the card deck (if any) in the card reader and press the card
       reader's START button.  Remember, only IOM-connected card readers may be
       used during the initial CP-6 boot.  FEP-connected low-cost unit-record
       peripherals (both line printers and card readers) cannot be used during
       the CP-6 system boot process.
 
       Depress the INITIALIZE button.  On the Low Cost Console (LCC), wait for
       the terminal to reset internally, i.e.,. until the DATA SET READY
       indicator stops flashing.  When the DSR indicator stops flashing, a
       message indicating the LCC status may or may not print.  If it does not
       print, press the RETURN key once.  The message should then print.  The
       message looks like the following:
 
           # CONSOLE READY VER x.x #
 
       Then press the BOOT button.  The LCC will sound its alarm at this point;
       type any character to silence it.  Do not follow this character by a
       RETURN!  The character is ignored by the system, is not echoed, and is
       only used to silence the "alarm".
 
       If a LCC is in use without the optional button pod, use the following
       key sequences instead of the INITIALIZE and BOOT buttons:
 
               <ESC> <CTL I>                      (for INITIALIZE)
               <RETURN>
               <ESC> <CTL B>                      (for BOOT)
 
           where <ESC> is the escape key and <CTL> is the control key.  Hold
           the control key down while typing the other indicated character.
 
       If the system pack has not been used as such before, the question
 
           'SYSTEM AREA SIZE - 0 OK TO PROCEED?
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB              To Begin a CP-6 Boot                      5-10
       
 
 
       will be asked.  Verify that the pack is the correct one to use; then,
       respond 'Y' and press EOM (on system control consoles) or RETURN (on low
       cost consoles).  This pack will become the DP#SYS packset during the
       boot process.  Note that any device designated as SYSTEM PACK must
       contain either a scratch pack, or a pack that has previously been used
       on the SYSTEM PACK device.
 
       Now is the time to use certain knowledge collected earlier.  In this
       case, you'll have to decide if your system pack needs to be VOLINITed.
       If it doesn't need to be VOLINITed, proceed to the subsection "Standard
       CP-6 Boot Scenarios".
 
 
 
       _______________________________________       TO BEGIN A CP-6 BOOT ON A DPS 90 SYSTEM
 
 
 
       Prepare a TIGR deck or a tape containing TIGR commands, if needed.
       Mount a disk pack on the device intended to hold the CP-6 system area.
       If device 1 on channel 8 is NOT used, it will be necessary to respond
       'D' (change device defaults) to the 'Change boot options...' question
       (shown below) to inform AARDVARK of the location of the pack containing
       the CP-6 system area.  It is also recommended that other disk drives be
       powered down during the boot, especially if they have an older version
       of DP#SYS mounted on them.
 
       On the DPS 90 there is a second console that can be an actual system
       console but it is not the default one.
 
       CP-6 and MSOS use different UR firmware.  Before booting CP-6, use the
       MSOS command 'LOAD UR CTR' to get the correct UR firmware loaded.  The
       system will respond with
 
           <something>  ENTER FW DECK NAME FOR MPC ON C,2 (EOM=UCMNA2)
 
       Your response should be:
 
           UCMNA3
 
           <something>  ENTER FW DECK NAME FOR MPC ON C,2 (EOM=UCRPB2)
 
       Your response should be:
 
           UCRPD3
 
           <something>  ENTER FW DECK NAME FOR MPC ON C,2 (EOM=U400L1)
 
       Your response should be:

       The disk pack destined to hold the CP-6 system area may be any of the
       following:
 
       1.  A virgin pack, never before used on any CP-6 system.  However, it
           must first be initialized using the VOLINIT process.  This may be
           accomplished by responding 'VO' to the 'TB/DB/OR/VO?' question.  The
           VOLINIT process is described in the subsection "Physical
           Initialization of Packs Via VOLINIT", and in the boot scenarios in
           the subsection "VOLINIT Execution".
 
       2.  A CP-6 scratch pack.  This pack has been previously SCRATCHed by the
           PIG processor on a running CP-6 system.  The boot process will
           properly initialize the system area.
 
       3.  A CP-6 system pack.  This pack has been used before for the purpose
           of holding the system area.  The boot process will properly
           initialize the system area.
 
           Note: As of AR4.0 Beta Release, there is an outstanding problem in
           building the system packs on a previously built 3-pack set.  If you
           wish to build #SYS on 3 packs, first scratch all 3 packs from PIG.
           Next perform the 'Yes' to new files boot; this builds the system
           pack on one of the packs first.  Once the system is up for the first
           time, you should then use PIG to EXTEND #SYS with the other two
           packs.  For further details on this problem, refer to STAR #41352 in
           STARLOG.
 
           Note: it is possible for the 'Yes' to new file boot to terminate
           with the error "System area too small - reboot".  This happens for
           the disk packs which have been previously made into more than 1
           section and occurs when there are more than two sections or when the
           second section section is neither #SYS nor scratched.  To ensure you
           don't run into this problem, before doing the boot, check that the
           disk pack contains no more than two sections and that the second
           section is either scratched or contains #SYS.  (This is not
           necessary if a VOLINIT is performed on the disk).  Refer to STAR
           #41962 in STARLOG for further information.
 
 
       Mount the first volume of the P.O. tape set on the device you will boot
       from.  If device 1 is not used as the boot device you must enter 'D' in
       response to the question 'Change boot options...' during the boot
       process.
 
       Place the card deck (if any) in the card reader and press the card
       reader's START button.  Remember, only IOP-connected card readers may be
       used during the initial CP-6 boot.  FEP-connected low-cost unit-record
       peripherals (both line printers and card readers) cannot be used during
       the CP-6 system boot process.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB     To Begin a CP-6 Boot on a DPS 90 System            5-12
       
 
 
       To boot CP-6 on a DPS 90 system when the IOPMPS has been previously
       booted with the proper configuration, the operator must start a dialog
       with MSOS (Maintenance System Operating Supervisor), which is part of
       the IOPMPS.
 
       **** NOTE ****
 
       If the IOPMPS has not been previously booted with the proper
       configuration, it will be necessary for you to do so, in accordance with
       the procedures outlined in the IOP startup manual, DY03.
 
       To start this dialog, the operator must press the <IOP REQ> key on the
       system console.  This causes MSOS to issue its prompt and await a
       command.  If you have performed a stand-alone VOLINIT on a DPS 90, you
       must type "STOP EPU" before booting the system.  The command to boot
       CP-6 from tape is "BOOT OPSYS".  Your CSO representative will have
       specified the default boot device address in the IOP startup deck.  If
       this is not the case, MSOS prints the following:
 
          MSV602 R hh:mm:ss OP SYS BOOT DEVICE ICCDD INVALID
                   ENTER ICCDD OR (S)TOP
 
       where ICCDD means:
 
       I is the IOP number
 
       CC is the channel number
 
       DD is the device number
 
 
       At this point, the operator must specify the device address of the boot
       device.  If the default tape density of the boot device is unknown to
       MSOS, it prints:
 
          MSV603 R hh:mm:ss OP SYS BOOT TAPE DENSITY INVALID
                   ENTER 800, 1600, 6250 OR (S)TOP
 
       After the density is entered, MSOS attempts to read the boot record from
       the boot device.  If the boot record cannot be read, MSOS prints:
 
          MSV661 R hh:mm:ss OP SYS BOOT DEVICE iccdd (ICCDD) ERROR
                 STATUS=xxxxxxxxxxxx
                 ENTER (R)ETRY, (A)LTERNATE OR (S)TOP
 
       If the boot device address is correct, and the error is correctable
       (e.g., tape was not at load point, device not ready, etc.) then the
       operator may type "R" to retry the operation.  MSOS responds with:
 
          MSV605 R hh:mm:ss RELOAD OP SYS BOOT DEVICE iccdd (ICCDD), EOM WHEN READY
 
       So when the device is readied, press <EOM>.
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB     To Begin a CP-6 Boot on a DPS 90 System            5-13
       
 
 
       If the device address is incorrect or there are non-correctable errors
       on the device, the operator may type "A" to force booting from an
       alternate device.  MSOS asks the following:
 
          MSV604 R hh:mm:ss ENTER ALTERNATE BOOT DEVICE "ICCDD"
 
       After being told the alternate device address, MSOS inquires about the
       density as shown above.
 
       After the boot record is successfully read, the boot process is
       identical to booting CP-6 on other hardware platforms.
 
       If the system pack has not been used as such before, the question
 
           'SYSTEM AREA SIZE - 0 OK TO PROCEED?
 
       will be asked.  Verify that the pack is the correct one to use; then
       respond 'Y' and press EOM.  This pack will become the DP#SYS packset
       during the boot process.  Note that any device designated as SYSTEM PACK
       must contain either a scratch pack, or a pack which has previously been
       used on the SYSTEM PACK device.
 
       Now is the time to use certain knowledge collected earlier.  In this
       case, you'll have to decide if your system pack needs to be VOLINITed.
       If it doesn't need to be VOLINITed, proceed to the subsection "Standard
       CP-6 Boot Scenarios".
 
 
 
       _________________________________________       TO BEGIN A CP-6 BOOT ON A DPS 8000 SYSTEM
 
 
 
       Prepare a TIGR deck or a tape containing TIGR commands, if needed.
       Please note that an additional system console must be defined in the
       TIGR deck to allow remote access; if the primary console resides at
       0-30, this console will reside at 0-31.  This console should normally be
       partitioned (STATUS=DOWN).  Mount a disk pack on the device intended to
       hold the CP-6 system area.  If device 1 on channel 64 is NOT used,
       respond 'D' (change device defaults) to the 'Change boot options...'
       question (shown below) to inform AARDVARK of the location of the pack
       containing the CP-6 system area.  It is recommended that other disk
       drives be powered down during the boot, especially if they have an older
       version of DP#SYS mounted on them.
 
       The disk pack destined to hold the CP-6 system area may be any of the
       following:

       1.  A virgin pack, never before used on any CP-6 system.  However, it
           must first be initialized using the VOLINIT process.  This may be
           accomplished by responding 'VO' to the 'TB/DB/OR/VO?' question.  The
           VOLINIT process is described in the subsection "Physical
           Initialization of Packs Via VOLINIT", and in the boot scenarios in
           the subsection "VOLINIT Execution".
 
       2.  A CP-6 scratch pack.  This pack has been previously SCRATCHed by the
           PIG processor on a running CP-6 system.  The boot process will
           properly initialize the system area.
 
       3.  A CP-6 system pack.  This pack has been used before for the purpose
           of holding the system area.  The boot process will properly
           initialize the system area.
 
           Note: As of AR4.0 Beta Release, there is an outstanding problem in
           building the system packs on a previously built 3-pack set.  If you
           wish to build #SYS on 3 packs, first scratch all 3 packs from PIG.
           Next perform the 'Yes' to new files boot; this builds the system
           pack on one of the packs first.  Once the system is up for the first
           time, you should then use PIG to EXTEND #SYS with the other two
           packs.  For further details on this problem, refer to STAR #41352 in
           STARLOG.
 
           Note: it is possible for the 'Yes' to new file boot to terminate
           with the error "System area too small - reboot".  This happens for
           the disk packs which have been previously made into more than 1
           section and occurs when there are more than two sections or when the
           second section section is neither #SYS nor scratched.  To ensure you
           don't run into this problem, before doing the boot, check that the
           disk pack contains no more than two sections and that the second
           section is either scratched or contains #SYS.  (This is not
           necessary if a VOLINIT is performed on the disk).  Refer to STAR
           #41962 in STARLOG for further information.
 
 
       Mount the first volume of the P.O. tape set on the device you will boot
       from.  If a non-FIPS subsystem is being used and device 1 is not used as
       the boot device, 'D' must be specified in response to the question
       'Change boot options...' during the boot process.  If a FIPS subsystem
       is being used, any device may be used as the boot device without
       changing the tape device default.
 
       Place the card deck (if any) in the card reader and press the card
       reader's START button.  Remember, only IMX-connected card readers may be
       used during the initial CP-6 boot.  FEP-connected low-cost unit-record
       peripherals (both line printers and card readers) cannot be used during
       the CP-6 system boot process.

                            CP-6 Boot on a DPS 8000 System
       
 
 
       Prior to booting the DPS 8000, the central system must be initialized.
       This is accomplished by issuing either the INIT and BOOT commands to the
       Service Processor or an IBOOT to the Service Processor.  In order to
       accomplish this, the operator must start a dialog with the Service
       Processor.
 
       **** NOTE ****
 
       The DPS 8000 must first be loaded with the proper configuration files by
       the Service Processor and MCA, in accordance with the techniques
       described in DPS 8000 SRBs SA76, SA77, and SA78, and also the Service
       Processor Maintenance Guide, 58096616.
 
       To start this dialog, the operator must activate a Service Processor
       read by typing <ESC><#>SP at the system console.  This causes the
       Service Processor to issue its prompt (SP>) and await a command.  The
       most common command to boot CP-6 from tape is "IBOOT".  Your CSO
       representative will have specified the default boot device address in
       the MCA configuration file.  If this is not the case, you should
       specify:
 
          SP>IBOOT IMXi Dd Ccc
 
       where:
 
       i is the IMX number
 
       d is the device number
 
       cc is the channel number
 
       Note:  In the following examples, the device number (e.g., dO) differs
       depending on the device type.  For FIPS and MDS devices, the device
       number is the actual device number (DEV#).  For non-FIPS or non-MDS type
       devices attached to MPCS, the device number should always be specified
       as 0 (e.g., d0) since the device number is selected by the controller
       and not by the SP.  If a nonzero device number is used on a non-FIPS
       type device, the SP prints a warning message that the controller can
       change the device number.
 
       The IBOOT default is specified as either a tape or disk device.  After
       an IBOOT, the working default is changed to the last IBOOT device and
       channel specified.  For example, if specifying channel and device, the
       next IBOOT done without specifying parameters will use the disk.
 
       Assume a tape boot where the boot device is device 0, channel 8 and IMX
       0.  The following commands initiate the boot:
 
           sp>init
           sp>boot imx0 d0 c8
 
       The same result is achieved by specifying:
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                   To Begin a                           5-16
                            CP-6 Boot on a DPS 8000 System
       
 
 
           sp>iboot imx0 d0 c8
 
       However, note that the IBOOT command does not function exactly like the
       INIT/BOOT sequence.  The IBOOT clears memory and should not be used when
       performing an operator recovery.
 
       Disk booting is parallel.  For example, if the system disk is on device
       1 and channel 64 is the address of the system disk (normal system disk
       settings), the following INIT/BOOT commands can be used:
 
           sp>init
           sp>boot imx0 d1 c64
 
       Or, the following IBOOT command can be used:
 
           sp>iboot imx0 d1 c64
 
       If a CPU FAULT$ON$FAULT is reported, the boot record was not
       successfully read.  If the boot device address is correct and the error
       is correctable (e.g., the tape was not at load point, the device was not
       ready, etc.), then the operator must restart the IBOOT after readying
       the device and using the following commands:
 
           SP>KILLBP
           SP>RLOAD SYS
 
       If the device address is incorrect, an IBOOT command must be issued
       specifying the correct device address after entering these commands.
 
       After the boot record is successfully read, the boot process is
       identical to booting CP-6 on other hardware platforms.
 
       If the system pack has not been used as such before, the question
 
           'SYSTEM AREA SIZE - 0 OK TO PROCEED?
 
       will be asked.  Verify that the pack is the correct one to use; then
       respond 'Y' and press EOM.  This pack will become the DP#SYS packset
       during the boot process.  Note that any device designated as SYSTEM PACK
       must contain either a scratch pack, or a pack that has previously been
       used on the SYSTEM PACK device.
 
       Now is the time to use certain knowledge collected earlier.  In this
       case, you'll have to decide if your system pack needs to be VOLINITed.
       If it doesn't need to be VOLINITed, proceed to the subsection "Standard
       CP-6 Boot Scenarios".

       ____________________________________________       PHYSICAL INITIALIZATION OF PACKS VIA VOLINIT
 
 
       The VOLINIT processor prepares a disk pack so that it may be used by the
       CP-6 system.  After VOLINIT has prepared a disk pack, the Packset
       Initializer may be used to assign the pack to a packset.
 
       The disk initialization tasks are as follows:
 
       o   Format the tracks into sectors and write address headers for the
           sectors.  If a track is bad, post an appropriate notation to the
           header of the first sector of that track.
 
       o   The Volume IDentification (VID) granule contains the following
           elements:
 
           Volume Serial Number
           Defective Track Table
           Packset Identification (if known)
           List of Other Volumes in the Packset (if known)
           Installation Identification (if known)
           Address of System Area directory (if a system pack)
 
           NOTE:  The volume serial number and defective track table are
           initialized by VOLINIT.  The VID elements are initialized by PIG.
 
 
 
       _________________       VOLINIT EXECUTION
 
 
       VOLINIT may be invoked as a stand-alone job at boot time (offline
       VOLINIT) or as a CP-6 processor (on-line VOLINIT).  Except for method of
       invocation, the processes and commands are the same.  More than one pack
       may be initialized by VOLINIT in any one session.  If you will be
       installing CP-6 on two spindles, you may find it useful to initialize
       both of them now.
 
       The procedure for invoking the boottime version of VOLINIT is as
       follows.
 
       o   Begin a tape boot.  The boot process proceeds similar to the
           following example.  This example contains the recommended responses
           IF YOUR SYSTEM IS CONFIGURED PER RECOMMENDATIONS.

       o   VOLINIT is now prompting for commands.
 
           (NOTE:  If you use the released TIGR deck which contains
           an AUTOCONFIG command, a device named DP01 is created, which will be
           the only disk drive on your system.  You must use DP01 as your "dev"
           when VOLINITing.)
 
       o   After completing VOLINIT, the system will then go idle.  The
           initialized pack may be dismounted for later use, or the operator
           may again press the boot button to start a normal boot to the
           initialized pack.
 
       When prompted by VOLINIT at the console, place the disk to be
       initialized on the device designated as the system disk during the
       boot.  Enter the following command:

       followed by <CR> or <EOM>.
 
       where:
 
           dev    is the designation of the drive on which the pack to be
           initialized is located, in the form DPnn, e.g., DP01
 
           vsn    is the volume serial number to be written on the disk pack.
           This can be any 1 to 6 digit number desired.
 
           DTT=NEW    instructs VOLINIT to disregard the defective track table
           on the disk pack and create a new DTT.
 
           FORMAT    instructs VOLINIT to format each track.  FORMAT is only
           allowed on MSU0451 devices.  All other devices are formatted using
           TOLTS test pages.
 
           TEST    instructs VOLINIT to add flawed tracks to the DTT.
 
       VOLINIT will then prompt with
 
           ENTER DTT:
 
       Enter the following, followed by <CR> or <EOM>:
 
           DTEND
 
       The VOLINIT process will begin.  It will take from 45 minutes to two
       hours, depending on the type of device and model of CPU.

       ____________________________       STANDARD CP-6 BOOT SCENARIOS
 
 
       The following two scripts should be used as guides during the initial
       boot.  Note that if any of the essential boot peripherals (disk, tape,
       line printer, and card reader) are configured on non-standard channels
       (DPS 8 and DPS 90 defaults:  disk = 8-9, tape = 16-17, line printer =
       24, and card reader = 25; DPS 8000 defaults: disk = 64-67, tape = 8-9,
       line printer = 40, and card reader = 38), the 'D' response should be
       given to the 'Change boot options...' question.  Detailed information on
       the CP-6 boot process can be found in the "CP-6 System Support
       Reference", Volume 3 (HA22) and the "CP-6 Operations Reference" (CE34).
 
       In the following scripts, user responses are underlined.  To complete
       the input press RETURN (on low cost console), or EOM (on older models).
       Note that on a DPS 90 system, only the EOM key can be used to satisfy
       input.
 
       The device addresses shown are for DPS 8 or DPS 90 systems; DPS 8000
       systems use a different set of default addresses.  On a DPS 90 system,
       the user will not see the firmware loaded messages that are shown in the
       following scripts.  The boot scenario shown below should be used to
       install a P.O. tape for the initial boot of a new release of CP-6 using
       the TIGR commands supplied.  Please refer to the "CP-6 System Support
       Reference" or the "CP-6 Operations Reference" manuals if the boot
       process deviates from the path shown below.

       You may also choose to boot with your TIGR deck entered directly from
       the console.  While entering TIGR commands from the console is generally
       a tricky business, due to TIGRs insensitivity to syntax errors, it may
       be done.  You may choose to enter TIGR commands from the console
       especially if you are booting onto a single 451-type disk and wish to
       have two available prior to restoring the "tools tapes".  Special
       instructions on entering TIGR commands from the console are in
       Appendix C of this document.

       ____________________________________       WHEN THE SYSTEM IS FINALLY BOOTED...
 
 
       The system comes up with output symbiont devices locked.  They can be
       started with the START Keyin, e.g.,
 
           !START LP01
 
       After the P.O.  tape has been booted with 'Y' to NEW FILE SYSTEM, use
       the following procedure to install the tools tape.
 
 
 
       _________________________       INSTALLING THE TOOLS TAPE
 
 
       The E05 system, support files, tools, manuals, SRBs and other files will
       not fit on a single 451 pack (a complete CP-6 order now puts 21,000+
       granules into .:SYS).  If you brought your system up in this
       configuration, you will need to modify the following installation
       instructions where marked: "IF BOOTING ON A SINGLE-451 SYSTEM".  You
       should look ahead and note all occurrences where the instructions say
       "IF BOOTING ON A SINGLE-451 SYSTEM".
 
       1.  Log on any terminal to :SYS,LJS.  If none is available, a console
           ghost can be used.  Log on by using the keyin:
 
                    GHOST :SYS,LJS
 
           on the console, and precede all commands below with G:. At this
           point, a console ghost may be more convenient until after step 4
           since no terminal profiles have been set up yet.
 
       2.  Install the EFT tools tape.
 
           If you have previously created a packset and accounts for the tools
           tape, go directly to step c. If you have created a packset but not
           the accounts, go to step b. If you have created neither, go to step
           a.
 
           ****************************************************************
                                         WARNING
                            **********************************
 
           The default for #SYS generated by an initial boot procedure is
           NOBACKUP.  Any accounts created on this packset will, by default,
           have these attributes.  Generally, this is not a problem since you
           should not put accounts that require backup on the system set.  (See
           the System Manager Handbook (CE60) for more information on the
           correct strategy for #SYS packset maintenance.)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB            Installing the Tools Tape                   5-23
           
 
 
           If you should need to backup the #SYS packset, be aware that the
           accounts to be backed up must have the attribute DEFAULT BACKUP
           (DB).  The attribute can be assigned either when the account is
           created or by using the PIG DEFAULT command to change the #SYS
           packset attribute to DEFAULT BACKUP.
 
           ****************************************************************
 
           a.  If you want to put the tools accounts on a pack other than
               DP#SYS, mount a VOLINITed pack on an available drive.  (See the
               VOLINIT section of the "CP-6 System Support Reference", Volume
               II (HA21) if it is necessary to VOLINIT a pack.)  When the pack
               is spinning, create a CP-6 pack using the following commands:
 
               !PIG
               SCRATCH DPnn AS nnnnn (insert drive number and vsn)
               BUILD DP#xx FROM nnnnn (insert packset name and vsn)
               END
 
               NOTE:  The commands above are a minimum; see the description of
               PIG in the "CP-6 System Support Reference", Volume I (HA20) for
               a detailed discussion of packset creation.
 
               If you desire to create a multi-spindle system set at this
               point, you may do so; however, the sequence requires some time
               and some special commands:
 
               !PIG
               SCRATCH DPnn as nnnnn      (insert drive number and vsn)
               SCRATCH DPxx as xxxxx      (insert drive number and vsn)
               EXTEND DP#SYS WITH nnnnn,xxxxx (nnnnn, xxxxx are vsns from above)
               END
 
               Now, the current DP#SYS must be taken logically offline and put
               back online to effect the remainder of the extension.  Go to the
               console and type:
 
               !DIE!
 
               The system-wide recovery will take DP#SYS off line and put it
               back online, merging the two separate spindles into a single
               logical packset.
 
           b.  Create the following accounts on the new packset.  (NOTE:  if
               you plan to build all these accounts on the same packset, for
               example on a packset called PACK1, simply enter:
 
                   !XEQ $XPIGALL.:SYS 'PACKSET'='PACK1'
 
               The following steps will be performed by this JCL:

           Your procedures are very different.  You will be restoring only
           those portions of the tools tapes that will enable you to build a
           bootable CP-6 PO tape set containing a TIGR deck that WILL contain
           enough disk drives so that you can restore all the tools tapes.
           Instead of the line
 
               DP#CP6AR5 TO DP#xx
 
           as seen above, use the line
 
               DP#CP6AR5/SKIP(.:DOCUM,.:SRB,.:QUAC,.:DEMOSI,.:CONVERT) TO DP#xx
 
           This should give your files in the accounts .:XSI, .:E05PRC and
            .SUPPORT.  These files will be used to rebuild your PO tape set.
           Proceed directly to "Building a New P.O. tape", below.  You will end
           up skipping several pages of instructions here.
 
           WHEN YOU HAVE REWRITTEN AND REBOOTED YOUR NEW PO TAPES, YOU SHOULD
           FOLLOW THE COMPLETE SET OF INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE.
 
       3.  Build output symbiont form definitions.  Installations which have
           XEQ files to build forms should run them now.  $XFORM.SUPPORT
           contains the XEQ job used at Perigon Solutions (formerly ACTC
           Technologies Inc.)  and is the job that was run in order to check
           out the rest of the installation process.  To avoid problems, you
           should
 
               !XEQ $XFORM.SUPPORT
 
           Note: This JCL removes the forms it creates before building them.
           On a newly booted system (naturally), these forms do not exist.  The
           JCL will print a number of messages of the form:
 
                Form PERF8 does not exist.
 
           Do not panic.  The JCL is operating as intended.
 
       4.  Build time-sharing terminal profile descriptions and define
           synchronous communication terminal and unit record peripheral (URP)
           profiles.
 
           The files are SUPER input files and are named: KA$PRF.:LIBRARY
           (async profiles), KY$PRF.:LIBRARY (unit-record profiles),
           KZ$RBTPRO.:LIBRARY (RBT profiles), and KZ$3270PRO.:LIBRARY (3270
           profiles).
 
               !SET M$LO LP
               !SET M$DO LP
               !SUPER KA$PRF.:LIBRARY

               !R M$DO
 
           Like the $XFORM JCL, this JCL "removes" profiles before creating
           them.  There will be a number of diagnostics issued, mostly of the
           form:
 
                Profile QQRSTYZ does not exist, switching to create mode.
 
           Do not panic.  This is expected behavior.  These error messages will
           be printed on the line printer.
 
           NOTE:  The following error is OK when running KA$PRF:
 
           CMD*REM PROFILE $ASYNC
             Profile $ASYNC removed.
             Graphics profile $ASYNC removed.  CMD*CREATE PROFILE $ASYNC ASYNC
             GRAPHICS are allowed, but no graphics are defined.
 
       5.  Create the X account.
 
           The X account contains a plethora of software that can be invaluable
           to a system manager and the system's users.  Failure to install and
           build the X account constitutes an incomplete system installation
           and can lead to trouble in following steps (and in the future).  Do
           not omit this step. This uses about 12,000 granules in .X.
 
               !PRIV FMS
               !BATCH $BUILD_X_ACCT.:XSI

           Go to the console and enter:
 
               !ON BA 1
 
           which will permit the batch job to start running.  This job takes
           approximately half an hour to complete.
 
           After the job completes successfully, users with minimal disk space
           can now delete all files in the :XSI account.  However, by deleting
           the source to the X account, you should be aware that you are
           depriving yourself and your users of an invaluable source of
           programming guidelines, standards and hints.

           Note: Under E05, there exists a problem rebuilding an up-to-date
           version of the X account tool called FILER. The above procedures
           will rebuild a version of FILER that is similar to the one released
           for AR 4.0.  This problem has been tracked as STAR 42967 in STARLOG.
 
 
           A special file of profiles created and maintained by CP-6 developers
           is now distributed in the X account as LADC_PROFILES.X; if you wish
           to install these profiles, now is the time to do it. Again, many
           messages saying "profile does not exist, switching to create mode."
           will be displayed.  This is normal behaviour.
 
                !SET M$LO LP
                !SUPER LADC_PROFILES.X
                !R
 
           Several X account tools are best installed in :SYS for maximum
           effectiveness.  This information, and other information about the X
           account, is contained in the HELP file for NEW.X.
 
                !HELP (NEW.X)

       6.  SRBs and system-supplied manuals.
 
           The SRBs and system-supplied manuals can be printed concurrently
           with the steps which follow.  To begin printing these documents
           refer to the subsections "Formatting and Printing Software Release
           Bulletins (SRBs)" and "Printing System-Supplied Manuals" later in
           this section.
 
       7.  Install the T&D (test and diagnostics) "deckfile", which is used by
           the CSO representative to run the TOLTS program to perform online
           tests and diagnostics. The IFAD tape (revision D.6) from the
           previous release shipment of CP-6 will need to be used for this
           purpose. If this IFAD tape or this version of the IFAD tape is not
           available, contact the CSO representative. The following procedure
           will request this IFAD tape to be mounted.
 
                !DEER
                ???BUILD FT#IFAD
                ???END
 
           This will use up about 2,000 granules of disk space in .:FED.
 
           If this is a DPS 8000 system, the MCA diagnostic diskettes must be
           MERGEd after the IFAD tape has been processed.  This procedure is
           discussed in the DPS 8000 SRBs SA76, SA77 and SA78.
 
       8.  Run the QUAC existence tests.  This is discussed next under the
           heading "Running Existence Tests".

           IF BOOTING ON A SINGLE-451 SYSTEM
 
           Save this step for AFTER rebooting with your full TIGR deck.
           Running existence tests with the AUTOCONFIG TIGR deck is guaranteed
           to have problems, particularly in areas where shared libraries and
           database processing is concerned.
 
       9.  Perform system management tasks, including authorizing users, and
           building/mounting packsets.
 
           Be sure to read, review, and follow each product's installation
           instructions.  For example, if you've ordered the CP-6 MAIL system,
           you should read the MAIL SRB for further installation instructions.
 
       10. Create the DEMO account.
 
           The :DEMOSI contains source and creation JCL for a large body of
           demonstration programs and games.  You may wish to skip this step if
           you wish to save granules or do not want to have games on your
           machine. Installation will require about 2,100 granules in the .DEMO
           account.
 
               !PRIV FMS
               !XEQ $BUILD_DEMO_ACCT.:DEMOSI
               !PRINT
 
 
           This should take about five minutes.  Now, if you wish, you can
           delete all of the source files in :DEMOSI to save granules:
 
               !PRIV FMS
               !DEL ?.:DEMOSI
               YES$
 
 
 
 
       _______________________       RUNNING EXISTENCE TESTS
 
 
       Existence tests verify the complete delivery and installation of a CP-6
       system.  Before running the existence tests, you need to verify that
       your TIGR deck has installed all ASLs and shared libraries that you have
       ordered.  See the sample TIGR decks in Appendix A for help.  Using
       AUTOCONFIG is almost guaranteed to result in incomplete or bad Existence
       Test runs.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB             Running Existence Tests                    5-29
       
 
 
       Two types of tests exist in the :QUAC account, both of which perform
       some form of elementary existence checking.  Tests of the first type are
       named with the prefix ORDR and the suffix SI; these check to see that
       every element of the products you ordered is included in your system.
       The output from these tests must be checked for a STEPCC of 0.  If the
       STEPCC for any of these tests is greater than 0, you are missing some
       component(s).  The missing components will be listed in the line(s) just
       above the line reporting the name of the test and the STEPCC.
 
       Tests of the second type have names of the form xx_name_GT4.  These
       tests check to see that each of the processors ordered responds properly
       when invoked; in some cases they check the performance of basic
       features.  These, too, should report a STEPCC of 0.
 
       To run the tests --
 
       After installing the new system and restoring the TOOLS tape(s), log on
       to an account which has SUPERA and PIGC processor privileges, e.g.,
       :SYS,LJS.  The following three commands create the accounts for running
       the tests and result in the main test driver job getting batched.
 
           !SET M$LO LP
           !XEQ $XSETUP.:QUAC
           !R
 
       Note the first and third commands above are optional.  This job creates
       a few pages of printing and the process will be much faster to print the
       output on a printer versus a console.
 
       Keyin
 
            !ON BA 1
 
       at the system console to permit batch jobs to start.
 
       When the QUAC tests are finished (this should take about 15 minutes),
       the message 'THIS IS THE LAST JOB IN THE QUAC STREAM' will be output on
       the system console. In addition, you will have a file called
       $RESULTS.:QUACRUN (this file is also copied to the printer at the end of
       all the tests) which consists of lines reporting the ATITLE and STEPCC
       of each test.  All of the STEPCCs should be zero.  After testing is
       complete, use SUPER to remove the testing account:
 
           !SUPER
           CMD*REM :QUACRUN,107TESTING (FACCOUNT)
           CMD*END
 
       Delete all files in the :QUAC account.

       _________________________       INITIAL FEP CONFIGURATION
 
 
 
       NOTE: DO NOT PERFORM INITIAL FEP CONFIGURATIONS UNTIL AFTER THE QUAC
       TESTS HAVE RUN.
 
       At this point, you should have at least one running FEP that can be used
       to perform the timesharing-oriented tasks necessary to get to this
       point.  E05 FEPs are "configured" by the NETCON processor automatically
       on "Yes to new file system" boots to contain the three minimal FEP
       handlers: NODEADMN, COUPLER, and ASYNC.  For all LOCAL FEPs (i.e., those
       connected to the CP-6 system with a coupler), you must have the handlers
       NODEADMN and COUPLER.  The cold boot process also puts the ASYNC handler
       into each FEP's configuration automatically.  If you need to use
       unit-record peripherals on a coupler-connected FEP, you should see
       Appendix B.  To pick up the latest patches from Perigon Solutions, you
       need to put BISYNC as a handler into the FEP that is configured to use
       this kind of line.  Simple examples of NETCON JCL can be found in
       Appendix D.
 
       If you choose to change the name of node #0 (the default HOST node), two
       very important things must be done:
 
       a.  You MUST redefine the name of your host, THEN redefine all FEPs
           connected to it using the CONTROL= option using NETCON.
 
            DELETE NODE = 0                           "Remove NODE 0 definition
            DEFINE  NODE = 0, NAME = BMSG, TYPE = ME       "DEFINE HOST NODE.
            DELETE NODE=1                             "Remove NODE 1 definition
            DEFINE NODE=1,NAME=FEP1,TYPE=FEP,CONTROL=BMSG  "DEFINE FEP1 NODE.
 
           Because the name of the controlling node is changing, all FEPs
           controlled by it must have their CONTROL clause updated accordingly.
 
       b.  After redefining your nodes in NETCON, you MUST perform the
           following keyin from the system console:
 
               !DIE!
 
       This restarts the system ghosts, which will reload the correct network
       information.  After the system recovers, you will need to reboot any
       reconfigured FEP.
 
       Go to the console and type:
 
       !BOOT FEP n        (where n is the number of the node to be booted)
 
       If the FEPs do not respond (reboot) after the keyin, you will have to
       re-initialize and reboot the FEPs from the FEP hardware, using the
       instructions in Section 3 of this SRB.

       ________________________       BUILDING A NEW P.O. TAPE
 
 
       A system booted according to the procedures outlined above will contain
       patches that were current when this version of the CP-6 operating system
       was initially released; your P.O. tape set contains a system which has
       been tested to successfully boot to this point.  Before bringing the
       system up for full production, it is wise to reboot with the newest
       patches available.  The patches available at general release time are in
       a file in .SUPPORT named :AR5PATCH.  It is this patch deck with which
       your P.O. tape set was written.  If a newer patch deck is available, it
       is named :AR5PATCH_RELnnn.:SYS, where nnn is the Bull HN fiscal week
       that the patch deck became available for general release.  This file
       should also be updated with the latest update packet made available
       weekly from Bull HN.  More details on patchfile naming, distribution and
       usage can be found in the file PMERGE_BULLETIN.SUPPORT.
 
       New users should contact the TAC via the Bull HN Response Center
       (1-800-241-1634).  You will need to find out what your sync logon to the
       support computer is and build a HASP workstation accordingly.
 
       To build a HASP workstation for acquiring patch update files, you must
       know the name with which Perigon Solutions will refer to you.  This name
       can be obtained by calling the TAC (which will also help you with any
       other phase of this process).  Once you know the name of your site, you
       must authorize a HASP workstation that Perigon Solutions will use to
       communicate with you:
 
           !XEQ SYNCLADC.SUPPORT XXX=mysitename
 
       where mysitename is the site i.d. by which Perigon Solutions will refer
       to you.
 
       The TAC will help you acquire your first patch update files.  See
       Section 6 for more details.
 
       Replace the TIGR commands in the patch deck with a set of commands that
       matches your hardware configuration as follows.
 
       Prepare your TIGR deck in a file called TIGR.  If you build your TIGR
       commands in the .SUPPORT account, the file name will be TIGR.SUPPORT.
       The first record must be:
 
            !TIGR "L66
 
       (That is, the !TIGR lines in the file called TIGR and the patchfile MUST
       match.)
 
       Copy the patch deck you are using over :AR5PATCH.SUPPORT.  If you have
       received an updated patch deck, it will have been restored from your
       P.O. tapes into .SUPPORT, as :AR5PATCH_RELnnn (as documented above).
       Perform the following steps:
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB            Building a New P.O. Tape                    5-32
       
 
 
            !L :AR5PATCH?.SUPPORT(A)
 
       This will yield the full file name of the patch deck you will want to
       use.  It will tell you the nnn part of the full filename.  Then enter
       the following command (substituting nnn as appropriate from the output
       of the previous step):
 
            !C :AR5PATCH_RELnnn.SUPPORT OVER :AR5PATCH.SUPPORT
 
       Next, use PMERGE to merge the files:
 
            !PMERGE.X
            *PMERGE TIGR.SUPPORT INTO :AR5PATCH.SUPPORT,*AR5PATCH
            *END
            !C *AR5PATCH OVER :AR5PATCH.SUPPORT
 
       Then, to create your PATCH tape, copy :AR5PATCH.SUPPORT (which now
       contains your PATCHes and TIGR deck) to tape as follows:
 
            !ORES MT(BPI)=1    WHERE BPI = 1600 OR 6250
            !C :AR5PATCH TO FT#PATCH
 
 
       NOTE:  PMERGE is no longer distributed in .SUPPORT - it is now only
       available in .X
 
       Next, rebuild the P.O. tape set.  $XDEF_HELP.SUPPORT documents
       procedures which can be used to rebuild P.O tapes.  READ THE
       $XDEF_HELP.SUPPORT FILE!  It contains important instructions which must
       be followed!  One important part of the $XDEF_HELP file is this command:
 
            !C M:MON.:SYS OVER M:MON.:E05PRC
 
       Perform the command, then BATCH or XEQ $XDEF_FULL.SUPPORT.
 
 
       If you created your P.O. tape set following the instructions under "IF
       BOOTING ON A SINGLE-451 SYSTEM", remember to start the installation
       process over.  It is generally recommended that you reboot, specifying
       "Y" to "New file system?", as that will guarantee the same initial
       installation conditions.  However, you will run the risk of clobbering
       your painstakingly crafted TIGR deck should anything go awry.  It is
       recommended that you make a copy of that TIGR deck on a scratch tape so
       that it may be recalled if necessary.  Try using the commands:
 
           !ORES MT(1600)=1
           !C TIGR.SUPPORT TO LT#TIGR/TIGR
           !C :AR5PATCH.SUPPORT TO LT#TIGR/:AR5PATCH
 
       If you do not have a "SINGLE-451" system, you should reboot with "S" to
       NEW FILE SYSTEM to properly install the software on the new P.O. tape
       set.

       In either case, you should first take the system "down" by going to the
       operator's console and entering this command:
 
            !ZAP!
 
       The process of ZAPping a CP-6 system shuts it down in an orderly
       fashion.
 
       After the message:
 
            ..That's all folks!
 
       appears on the console, the ZAP! is completed.
 
 
 
       ____________________       BEGINNING PRODUCTION
 
 
       After you reboot, CP-6 is technically 'up'; however, various
       administrative chores must be performed before permitting general access
       to the system.
 
       One thing to keep in mind is that a new TIGR deck can possibly redefine
       the set of "LOCAL" (i.e., IOM-connected) devices.  If you say:
 
            !SUPER
            CMD*RECONFIG STATION LOCAL
 
       you can include any recently added unit-record devices in your STATION
       LOCAL definition.  If you had any FEP-connected LOCAL devices, you must
       redefine them after using the "RECONFIG STATION LOCAL" command.  See the
       instructions for FEP-connected UNIT RECORD DEVICES in Appendix B.
 
       A full set of SRBs should be printed.  Manuals which are not on site
       should also be printed.  This process is described in the next section.
 
       The current state of the machine allows you to log on to :SYS and create
       files on the system pack; general use of the system in this condition
       would be confusing at best and disastrous at worst.  Therefore, the
       first order of business should be to establish the valid logon
       identifications (ids) which may be used.  Three accounts have already
       been created:  :SYS,LJS, :SYSTAC,LADC and :FED,SUPPORT.  The latter is
       provided to allow Bull HN Customer Service personnel to run test and
       diagnostic (T&D) programs in support of the hardware.  The :SYSTAC
       account is used, remotely, by Perigon Solutions to help maintain the
       system.  You will want to password these accounts before beginning full
       production.

                                    IMPORTANT NOTE

       E05_HOST_SRB              Beginning Production                      5-34
       
 
 
       The support philosophy of CP-6 requires that Perigon Solutions and the
       CSO TAC be able to log on to your system and use CP-6 standard supplied
       analysis facilities in order to perform timely problem analysis with the
       hope of providing timely problem resolution.  In other words, Perigon
       Solutions expects to be able to log on to your system with the logon
       :SYSTAC,LADC, and with the privileges which that account is created with
       BY DEFAULT.  Those privileges, in general, include the ability to access
       files, run the host and FEP analysis programs, snap running memory in
       the host or FEP, and other (generally high-privilege) processes.
       Denying Perigon Solutions access to your system through anything but a
       fully privileged :SYSTAC account will in many cases extend the
       resolution time of stars you submit.  You will be required to provide,
       in lieu of privileged system access, complete supporting problem
       documentation through the mail or other, non-electronic means.
       Meanwhile, the STAR will be placed in DOCUM status and problem analysis
       will be suspended until Perigon Solutions has received adequate
       documentation.
 
           ****************************************************************
 
 
       The process of authorizing user logons is accomplished using the SUPER
       processor described in detail in Volume 2 of the "CP-6 System Support
       Reference" (HA21).
 
       It is recommended that privileges not be generally available; they
       provide powerful capabilities which are not necessary for common use.
 
       Now that the logon identifications have been established, the CP-6 file
       management packsets must be defined.  This is accomplished using the PIG
       processor, described in Volume 1 of the "CP-6 System Support Reference"
       (HA20).  The installation manager must organize the users of disk
       storage into groups that will reside on a given packset, determine their
       space requirements, and then use PIG to create the packset with its
       resident accounts.  The home packset established by SUPER for the logon
       identifier should reference the packset name containing the appropriate
       file management account.  Host and FEP dumps are generated in a
       file-only account on the system packset called :SYSTAC.  You should
       provide write access to that account for the accounts used by your
       support personnel; it should always remain accessible to :SYS also.
 
       When planning the file management environment, take care to not disturb
       accounts built by the system on the #SYS pack.  These include :SYS,
       :SYMI, :SYMO, :MAIL, and :SYSTAC. Do not reduce granule allocations or
       move the accounts from DP#SYS.  Do not remove write access to these
       accounts by users running in the :SYS account.
 
       Read the SRBs that come with the system.  Some products, like MAIL,
       require some special attention that is discussed in that product's SRB.

       CP-6 is now ready for use; users may log on and build files, compile,
       link, and debug their programs.  Note that once the packsets have been
       created, operator keyins to mount them are all that is required
       following a cold boot of the system; packsets mounted prior to a system
       crash are automatically remounted following recovery.  Pack sets can be
       cataloged so that the operator need never explicitly mount the packsets.
 
       See Appendix A for Sample Control Files.
 
 
 
       _________________________________________________________       FORMATTING AND PRINTING SOFTWARE RELEASE BULLETINS (SRBS)
 
 
       The :SRB account contains the SRBs in FASTEXT format.  This account also
       contains an XEQ file that formats the SRBs, directing the output to the
       line printer or uniquely named unit-record files that can be later
       copied to the line printer.  An estimate of the paper quantities and a
       description of the forms LONG, WIDE, and STDLP is found in Section 4,
       "AR5.0 System-Supplied Documentation".
 
       Each SRB will take about five minutes of CPU time to create.  To prevent
       swamping your system, the job streams released in AR5.0 are setup to
       allow only one document assembly job to run at a time.  If you wish to
       be able to run more than one SRB at a time, you must issue this set of
       commands PRIOR to !XEQing anything else.

       ___________________       Formatting the SRBS
 
 
       From an account that has at least 1000 free granules and also read
       access to :SRB, issue the following command:
 
           !XEQ $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB [option[,option]...]
             or
           !BATCH $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB [option[,option]...]
 
       Valid options are:
 
       FDS='fidlist'    specifies a list of files to be formatted.  The default
       is all the SRBs in the :SRB account.
 
       ACT=account    specifies the account in which the files reside.  The
       default is :SRB.

       FMT={D|L}    valid formats are D and L.  FMT=D (the default) is used for
       FRM=LONG or FRM=WIDE.  FMT=L should be specified, if FRM=STDLP is also
       specified.
 
       FRM={LONG|WIDE|STDLP}    specifies the logical form for the paper stock
       on which the documents are to be printed.  FRM=LONG is the default.
       FRM=STDLP should be specified, if FMT=L is also specified.
 
       DVC=device    specifies that the output is to be immediately directed to
       the specified device or file.  IF DVC is not specified, the
       $XTEXTALL_SRBS job creates a unit-record file for each SRB named
       according to the following convention:
 
            srbfile_UR_formname
 
       For example, if FRM=LONG and FDS=':E05_HOST', the unit-record file would
       be named:
 
            :E05_HOST_UR_LONG
 
 
 
       ___________________________       Examples of Formatting SRBs
 
 
           !XEQ $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB
 
       creates unit record files for all the SRBs currently in the :SRB
       account.
 
 
           !XEQ $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB FRM=STDLP,FMT=L
 
       creates unit-record files for all the SRBs in :SRB, formatted for the
       STDLP form.
 
 
           !XEQ $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB FDS=':E05_HOST',FRM=WIDE
 
       creates a unit-record file called :E05_HOST_UR_WIDE.

       _________________       Printing the SRBs
 
 
       To obtain a copy of any of the SRBs, issue the following command
       sequence, after the jobs spawned by $XTEXTALL_SRBS have run to
       completion:
 
            !LDEV LP99 LP@LOCAL,FORM='form'
            !COPY srbfile_UR_form to LP99
            !PRINT
 
       The workstation @LOCAL can be any workstation that has the proper form
       mounted.  Example:
 
           !XEQ $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB FDS=':E05_HOST',FRM=WIDE
              (wait until spawned job has run)
           !LDEV LP99 LP@LOCAL,FORM='WIDE'
           !COPY :E05_HOST_UR_WIDE TO LP99
           !PRINT
 
       Note that the LONG, WIDE, and STDLP forms are created by XEQing as
       described under "Installing the Tools Tape", above.
 
       To start batch jobs, the following keyin must be issued from the
       console, if it has not already been issued:
 
           !ON BA 1
 
 
 
       _______________________       SYSTEM-SUPPLIED MANUALS
 
 
       The :DOCUM account contains the manuals preformatted for printing on
       form "LONG", which is created by the $XFORM.SUPPORT job (above), and is
       defined to be 85 characters wide and 66 lines long.
 
       Note that formattable source for manuals is no longer supplied as it was
       prior to the D00 release.  Perigon Solution uses the CAP product to
       format the manuals; CAP is a separately priced product.
 
       The :DOCUM account also contains an XEQ file that directs the printing
       of specified manuals to the line printer.  An estimate of the paper
       quantities is found in Section 4, "AR5.0 System-Supplied Documentation".
       It may prove prudent to be selective about which manuals you choose to
       print first, as some manuals are quite sizable.

             or
           !BATCH $XCOPYALL_MANUALS.:DOCUM [option[,option]...]
 
       Valid options are:
 
       FDS='fidlist'    specifies a list of files to be formatted.  The default
       is all the manual files in the :DOCUM account.
 
       ACT=account    specifies the account in which the files reside.  The
       default is :DOCUM.
 
       NBR=n    specifies the number of copies to print.
 
       FRM={LONG|CONT8}    specifies the logical form for the paper stock on
       which the documents are to be printed.  FRM=LONG is the default.
       Specifying FRM=CONT8 produces a page for page equivalent to LONG form on
       STDLP using 8 LPI.  The LONG and CONT8 forms are created by XEQing
       $XFORM, as described in "Installing the Tools Tape", above.

       _________________       PROBLEM REPORTING
 
 
       If problems are encountered with the CP-6 system, either hardware or
       software, the customer should contact a Bull HN representative at the
       Response Center:
 
            1-800-285-8008 Software (US)
            1-800-285-9009 Hardware (US)
            1-602-862-6500 Software (Canada)
            1-800-268-4191 Hardware (Canada)
 
       The specifics of the problem should be defined, after which the
       complaint will be forwarded to the Technical Assistance Center (TAC) in
       Phoenix, Arizona USA.  A TAC representative will then perform further
       analysis of the problem, perhaps by logging on to the customer's
       machine.  The TAC representative will establish direct communication
       with the customer regarding the problem.
 
       Problems may also be reported via the CP-6 STARLOG system on the CP-6
       Support Computer. STARLOG is a program which gives access to the CP-6
       problem/solution database. Access to the CP-6 Support system can be made
       interactively via 1200 or 2400 baud async terminals connected through
       the Compuserve data network, or in a remote batch mode when a customer's
       machine is connected to the CP-6 support machine through 2400, 4800 or
       9600 baud synchronous communication lines.
 
       STARLOG records all problems entered against any CP-6 product, both when
       a customer enters it directly into STARLOG, and when the TAC enters one
       on a customer's behalf.  A dialogue on the problem can then begin
       between all support organizations within Bull HN, Bull HN Customer
       Service personnel, and the originating customer, to provide timely
       resolution of problems.  Much of this dialogue is visible to all
       customers, providing a sophisticated interactive "known problem" data
       base.  Customers can be aware of problems encountered and fixes provided
       throughout the CP-6 customer base on a daily basis.

       More information regarding access to and use of the STARLOG system can
       be obtained from the STARLOG Reference Manual (CE61) supplied with this
       system and CP-6 TAC.

       authorization to the CP-6 Support Computer.  The correct dial-up phone
       number for the support computer may be obtained from the TAC center.
       The password supplied is a random number which is difficult to type and
       remember.  The customer may change the password supplied as desired.
 
       This logon is intended to provide the customer access to various patch
       files and information files in account ZZZPATCH.  The patch files are
       updated by Perigon Solutions at predetermined intervals; the TAC can
       supply more details about the distribution schedule.
 
       The current patch deck updates are also packaged and placed in the
       output symbiont for transmission to all customers with 2400 baud
       synchronous transmission capability.  When the synchronous connection is
       made between the customer's machine and the support machine each
       Thursday afternoon, the patch file is transferred to the customer's
       :SYSTAC account.  More information on this method of patch transmission
       is available from the CP-6 TAC.
 
 
       The following are the current phone numbers for accessing the support
       computer at Perigon Solutions in Calgary, Alberta, Canada:

                                    IMPORTANT NOTE
                          **********************************
 
       Customers are expected to stay "up to date" on patches.  At minimum,
       that means that a customer must put a procedure into place to
       incorporate the most recent patches on a monthly basis.  It is better to
       incorporate patches on a bi-monthly basis.  Perigon Solutions actually
       can help support a site with less manpower and overhead if the site is
       "up to date" on patches.  If the site is not up to date on patches,
       Perigon Solutions may require the site to bring their software "up to
       date" before beginning work on a high severity STAR.

       After receiving the new patches, the customer runs
       $XPATCH_WEEKLY.SUPPORT to merge the new patches into the current patch
       deck.  This process is described more fully in the HELP file for PMERGE:
 
           !HELP (PMERGE.X)
 
       After the patch deck is ready, $XDEF_MINI.SUPPORT is used to rebuild the
       first volume of the P.O. tape set which can then be used with the
       existing volume 2 (and possibly 3) to reboot the system.  Boots of this
       type, for the purpose of installing new patches, are done with 'S' to
       NEW FILE SYSTEM.

       This section describes procedures for AR4.0 users to use to convert to
       AR5.0.  These procedures are for the HOST and FEP only.  Consult each
       Language Processor's SRB for information on conversion in that area.
 
       The intent of this section is to highlight new features as well as
       differences between the AR4.0 release of CP-6 and the AR5.0 release.
       The reader should refer to appropriate reference manuals for complete
       descriptions of each item highlighted.
 
       Note that this SRB discusses moving from AR4.0 to AR5.0 only.
 
       New CP-6 Operating System releases must ALWAYS be booted from tape,
       answering the question "New file system?" with "Y".  There are always
       some changes from release to release that will prevent the user from
       booting a new system ANY OTHER WAY.
 
 
 
 
       _______________________       REBUILDING SYSTEM PACKS
 
 
       If you intend to re-build over your AR4 system packs, existing accounts
       on those packs will be destroyed in the process.  Check what accounts
       you have on your AR4.0 system packs (PIG LIST on DP#SYS will tell you),
       and then ensure that ALL your system accounts are saved (either to tape
       or to another disk pack) so later,if necessary, they can be retrieved
       onto your system packs. (EFT's TRANSPORT facility provides a good means
       for doing this).  Remember to also save accounts that will be
       automatically recreated, since the existing files in those accounts will
       be destroyed. For example, a new .:SYSTAC will be created but any
       previous dump files in that account will be lost unless you save them
       before the rebuild. However, the most convenient method is to not build
       over your existing AR4.0 system packs but to use a different set of
       system packs for AR5.  That way, once you are up on AR5, you can simply
       EFT TRANSPORT the accounts/files that are needed from your old system
       packs to your new system packs. This assumes that sufficient drives are
       available on-line to hold both system packs.
 
       When AR5.0 is up, you should selectively restore the accounts/files that
       you need.

       ___________________________________________       SYNC TERMINALS, LINKS, DEVICES AND PROFILES
 
 
       If you are moving from AR4.0 to AR5.0, remember that all sync terminals,
       links, devices, and profiles must be rebuilt from JCL.  Therefore, you
       must make sure that JCL has been prepared for all site-specific items in
       these categories.  The reason for this is to ensure that system data
       files (such as :NETCON) are rebuilt properly in case there are data
       format changes to the files.  (:HLP, :USERS, and :PROJ records for users
       are the same between E04 and E05.)
 
       To move your users from AR4.0 to AR5.0, you should follow the
       instructions shown below.  However, it is possible to save the following
       AR4.0 files to tape and restore them for AR5.0: :NETCON, :WSN, :PRO,
       :FORM.  If you copy these files from AR4.0 to AR5.0 you will not need to
       run the JCLs that build them.  However, even though copying these files
       may be more convenient, it not recommended since rebuilding from JCL
       ensures a clean build for these files.

       If an existing AR4.0 site has not restored and re-archived its B03
       archive tapes, and would like to continue to use EFT_B03 on AR5.0, you
       must save the C01 :SHARED_SYSTEM you used for EFT_B03 from your current
       system and add it to your PO tape and TIGR deck.  Then you will need to
       use GIN.X to modify EFT_B03 to point at the saved library.
 
 
 
 
       ____________________       THE MIRROR PROCESSOR
 
 
 
       The mirrored disk facility is now available as a standard host product
       under AR5.0.  It ensures that failure of a critical disk unit will not
       cause loss of service.
 
       Mirrored disk sets up a second disk unit to mirror a critical disk unit.
       This is known as a Mirrored Disk Pair.  The mirrored disk software
       ensures that both units in the pair are maintained as exact copies of
       each other.  Should one unit fail in service, the other member of the
       pair will take over for the failing unit immediately.
 
       The mirrored disk software is capable of determining what errors are
       transient, and which require human intervention.  In the case of
       transient errors, the failing member disk pair is not removed from
       service, although the fault is logged.  In the case of persistent
       errors, the failing unit is removed from service, and may be repaired or
       replaced at leisure.
 
       Any disk type supported by CP-6 may be mirrored.  The smallest unit that
       may be mirrored is a disk actuator.  Each mirrored actuator must be
       paired with another actuator of equivalent type and size.  Additionally,
       the Defective Track Table of each actuator must be identical.
 
       The unmanaged portion of the system disk may not be mirrored.  If this
       disk is mirrored, and the primary disk fails, CP-6 will not go through
       recovery correctly.  CP-6 service could be restored in such a case by
       performing a Reconfig Boot (MXT), designating the mirrored copy as the
       system disk.

       WARNING:
       Mirrored disk should not be used to replace disaster recovery
       techniques, such as tape backup.  Existing backup and recovery
       facilities will work correctly with the mirrored disk facility.
 
 
 
       _________       X ACCOUNT
 
 
       The following X account tools were updated since the AR4.0 release:
 
       DATE        GIN         PATCH
 
       The following were specifically modified to be Year 2000 Ready:
 
       BISON       CALEN       DATE       GIMME       JEDI       RATFOR
       THING       TIDY        VOUCHER
 
 
       No new tools were added to the X account.
 
 
       For the AR5.0 release, there were no new tools and 11 changed tools.
       tools.  There are approximately 380 tools. The .:XSI account is now
       27,000 granules in size.  The X account now requires 12,000 granules.
 
 
 
 
       ______________________________       RELINKING OF USER APPLICATIONS
 
 
       In order to pick up changes made to some of the system libraries, users
       should as a minimum re-link their applications. Failure to do so may
       mean the application may not be running with all the latest changes.
 
 
 
       _________________       SUPPORT FOR AR4.0
 
 
       Please note that as is typical with previous releases of CP-6, the
       availability of a new release means support for the previous release
       will shortly expire. Thus, support for AR4.0 will cease on Oct. 1, 1998,
       approximately seven months after the availability of AR5.0.  Customers
       are therefore encouraged to migrate to AR5.0 as soon as possible.

                                                    INSTALLING UNITREC PRINTERS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       _______________________________________       FEP UNIT RECORD PERIPHERAL INSTALLATION
 
 
       The following discussion is taken from the CP-6 System Support Reference
       set (HA20, HA21, HA22).
 
       The following steps are necessary to install Unit Record Peripherals
       connected to FEPs.
 
       Assume a Unit Record device is connected to FEP 1 on channel 700.  The
       installation process is divided into four sections: defining the
       workstation and device via SUPER, setting up the boot information for
       the FEP to include UNITREC, booting the FEP, and configuring the device
       via NETCON.
 
       1.  SUPER - Assume the workstation (WSN) that the device is to be
           associated with is BOSTON (though it can just as easily be a part of
           the LOCAL WSN).  In SUPER, create a unique device for WSN BOSTON.
           Assume the device name is DEVNAME.  Associate a TYPE with the device
           that identifies the device type (e.g., LP, CR, or CP).  Associate a
           PROFILE that corresponds to the device type (PRU9117, PRU9118,
           PRF9118, or PRU9109 for LP; CRU9111 for CR; PCU9101 for CP).  Refer
           to Section 18 of the "CP-6 System Support Reference", Volume 1
           (HA20) for complete instructions.  After all the options desired for
           creating the device are entered, SUPER will respond "ddxx CREATED",
           where 'dd' is the device type (LP, CR, or CP) and 'xx' is a two
           digit number.
 
                REM WSN BOSTON
                REM STAT BOSTON
                CR STAT BOSTON
                CR DEV DEVNAME FOR STATION BOSTON
                USE=OUT
                TYPE=LP
                PROFILE=PRU9109
                FORM=STDLP
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB     FEP Unit Record Peripheral Installation             B-1
           
 
 
                UPLOCKED=NO
                END
                CR WSN BOSTON FOR STATION BOSTON
                DFORM LP STDLP
                END
 
 
           To associate the same printer with WSN LOCAL instead of BOSTON the
           following commands would be necessary:
 
                REM WSN LOCAL
                CR DEV DEVNAME FOR STATION LOCAL
                USE=OUT
                TYPE=LP
                PROFILE=PRU9109
                FORM=STDLP
                UPLOCKED=NO
                END
                CR WSN LOCAL FOR STATION LOCAL
                DFORM LP STDLP
                END
 
           Note that the REM STAT LOCAL and CR STAT LOCAL commands are not
           included when associating devices with WSN LOCAL.
 
 
       2.  Unit record - using NETCON, set the BOOTINFO for the FEP to include
           UNITREC as one of the handlers.  (There are NETCON JCL examples in
           Appendix D.)
 
              !NETCON
              NETCON E05 HERE
              HOST    * SELECT NODE=1
              L6I     * SET BOOT MONITOR=M:FEP, ;
              L6I     *      LIBRARY=:SYS,;
              L6I     *      HANDLER=NODEADMN(BOOT=YES),;
              L6I     *      HANDLER=COUPLER(BOOT=YES),;
              L6I     *      HANDLER=ASYNC(BOOT=YES),;
              L6I     *      HANDLER=UNITREC(BOOT=YES)
              L6I     * END
 
           This is an example of how to set up the UNITREC handler in FEP 1.
           You really also need to setup the DEFAULT parameters for each
           handler in this FEP as well, and that information is in Appendix D,
           as well.
 
       3.  Boot FEP 1.
 
       4.  Invoke NETCON and enter the following commands:
 
               SEL N=1                         (to select FEP 1)
               KILL .700
               CONFIG .700 LOGON='DEVNAME',PROFILE='PRU9118',ATTR=.8000

       the device connected to the FEP from a CP-6 operator console, use the
       same keyins as for IOM-connected devices (with the exception of the
       ERROR keyin).  Refer to the "CP-6 Operations Reference" manual (CE34)
       for complete instructions.

       When entering TIGR commands from the console, it is wise to avoid extra
       entries.  The following is the minimum set of TIGR commands required for
       a successful boot.  Modify channel numbers to your configuration.  Do
       not leave out any of the MON commands.
 
       A system booted with the SPROC commands below will not pass the QUAC
       tests for FORTRAN, IDS, SORT, MERGE, RPG, ARES, or COBOL, as the shared
       libraries required by these processors will not be installed.  Before
       running QUAC tests, either reboot with a full set of TIGR commands, or
       install the libraries with SPIDER.

       __________________________________________________       HOW TO READ TIGR COMMANDS FROM A SECOND PATCH TAPE
 
 
       1)  You must first create the second patch tape.  This is done with PCL
           on a running system:
 
               !C MYTIGRDECK TO FT#ANY (RECS=80)
 
           Make sure that your TIGR deck has a !TIGR at the beginning and a
           !FIN at the end.  Make sure that the density of the second patch
           tape is the same as your P01.
 
       2)  To enter TIGR commands from this tape, you must request that the
           PATCHING defaults be changed (in addition to any other options that
           may be necessary):
 
                                                               _               Change boot options (Y/N)/(ADPXF)/(? for help)? P
 
       3)  You must also tell AARDVARK that you wish to use a second patch
           tape:
 
               Second patch tape (Y/N)? Y
 
       4)  Entering "P" above will make AARDVARK prompt for the origin of
           various patches; you must tell AARDVARK not to get the TIGR ("T")
           patches from the boot tape:
 
                                                          _____               Tape1 patches (Y/N)/(MXTRPB)/(? for help)? MXRPB
 
       5)  To tell AARDVARK that the TIGR input is to come from the second
           patch tape, you must specify "T" to the Tape2 prompt:
 
                                                          _               Tape2 patches (Y/N)/(MXTRPB)/(? for help)? T
 
       6)  That's all there is to it!
 
 
 
       _______________________________________       HOW TO READ TIGR COMMANDS FROM CONSOLES
 
 
       1)  To enter TIGR commands from a console, you must request that the
           PATCHING defaults be changed (in addition to any other options that
           may be necessary):
 
                                                               _               Change boot options (Y/N)/(ADPXF)/(? for help)? P
 
       2)  Entering "P" above will make AARDVARK prompt for the origin of
           various patches; you must tell AARDVARK not to get the TIGR ("T")
           patches from the tape or cards:
 
                                                         _____               Tape patches (Y/N)/(MXTRPB)/(? for help)? MXRPB
                                                         _               Card patches (Y/N)/(MXTRPB)/(? for help)? N
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB     How to Read TIGR Commands from Consoles             C-2
           
 
 
       3)  To tell AARDVARK that the TIGR input is to come from the console,
           you must specify "T" to the console prompt:
 
                                                            _               Console patches (Y/N)/(MXTRPB)/(? for help)? T
 
       4)  After waiting awhile, while XDELTA reads the patches, you will
           notice that nothing seems to be happening.  That is the time to
           type:
 
               !TIGR
               R ME
 
           (Note: if nothing echoes, the console is not "active".  You must
           wait for the console read to become "active" before typing these two
           commands.)
 
       5)  TIGR will then prompt you for each input record with:
 
               TIGR HERE
               $
 
           You can then input your TIGR commands with continuation just as they
           appear in the TIGR deck.
 
       6)  THERE CANNOT BE ANY TYPING ERRORS IN THIS STEP!  If you make a
           typing error here, you will have to START THE BOOT OVER!  After the
           last command line type:
 
               R PA
               !FIN
 
           (Since TIGR does not prompt, this will all be on one line, e.g.,
 
               $R PA!FIN
 
           so it will look kind of funny.)
 
       7)  RESIST THE URGE TO TYPE "END" WHILE ENTERING THE TIGR COMMANDS.
           TIGR accepts the END command and does just that; END.  Kiss whatever
           other patching and booting you had in mind "goodbye", and start
           over.

       This section discusses certain basic FEP configuration by the use of the

       "CP-6 System Manager Handbook" or the "CP-6 System Support Reference"
       set.
 
       Some particular notes:
 
       1.  It is recommended that NODEADMN be the first handler defined in each
           FEP.
 
       2.  It is recommended that COUPLER be the second handler defined in each
           LOCAL FEP.
 
       3.  It is recommended that HDLCX25 be the second handler defined in each
           REMOTE FEP.
 
       4.  NODEADMN and HDLCX25 MUST BE WRITTEN on a REMOTE FEP's boot
           diskette, along with :SHARED_LCP6_SYSTEM and M:FEP.

       ___________________       3270 CONSIDERATIONS
 
 
       $XINSTALL creates :SYS3270 and copies :SHARED_LCP6_RELEASE.:SYS to
       :SYS3270 after the patching is done.  This means that when you have a
       FEP that contains BISYNC to support 3270's, you point the FEP boot
       definition at the library in :SYS3270.
 
 
 
       _________________________       POLLED VIP CONSIDERATIONS
 
 
       A FEP which is to support Polled VIP lines must be configured to use
       BISYNC77.:SYS instead of BISYNC.:SYS as the BISYNC handler.
 
 
 
       ___________________       SLCC CONSIDERATIONS
 
 
       Single Line Communication Controllers (SLCC) are now supported by
       HDLCX25 handlers for multihost and RFEP links.  SLCC links must have the
       SUPER PROFILE option EXTENDED SEQUENCE set to YES for the LINK and
       VIRTUAL CIRCUIT profiles.  The NETCON HDLCX25 handler parameter IOMEM
       cannot be set to a value greater than 127.
 
 
 
       ___________________       X.29 CONSIDERATIONS
 
 
       Before using X.29
       =================
 
       Multiplexing remote asynchronous terminal connections onto a single HDLC
       link presents significant savings in hardware costs, increased
       accessibility (up to 255 circuits per link), and better throughput and
       response than dial-up lines through low speed modems. In AR5.0 CP-6,
       this is provided for by the X.29 service.
 
       Assume HDLC channel 5400 of FEP 1 has been assigned the network address
       2136496870 by Tymnet (a Public Data Network in the United States). Then
       to support asynchronous terminals dialing in or connected to any Tymnet
       PAD (Packet Assembler Disassembler), follow the steps below:

       __________________________________________________       SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LARGE RFEP CONFIGURATIONS
 
 
       Due to space limitations on the 5.25" diskettes, it is not possible to
       use PIGETTE to make a boot diskette containing more than 2 handlers.
       The two handlers must be HDLCX25 and NODEADMN.  Basically, RFEPs require
       ALL of the second drive, and about 10-12 tracks of the first drive to be
       able to dump and recover properly.  E05 PIGLET tells you how much of
       your drive 0 space you're going to use.  The remainder of the handlers
       must be dynamically downline loaded.  Here's what the procedure looks
       like in AR5.0
 
       1)  Define the RFEP boot configuration using only the NEW form of the
           SET BOOT command.
 
           !NETCON
           *SEL N=12
           *SET BOOT HAND=NODEADMN(BOOT=YES)
           *SET BOOT HAND=HDLCX25(BOOT=YES)
           *SET BOOT HAND=ASYNC(BOOT=NO)
           *SET BOOT HAND=UNITREC(BOOT=NO)
           *SET BOOT LIBRARY=.:SYS
           *END
 
 
       2)  When the remote connects to the host, FROG downline loads the
           remaining handlers specified in the BOOT INFO.  Since FROG uses the
           M$OPEN system service to start a handler, the handlers must be
           authorized for "logon" using SUPER:
 
               !SUPER
               CR :SYS,ASYNC
               AC F = YES
               AC O = NO
               AC B = NO
               FEMFPRG=1
               FEMINTS H = 10
               FEMTI H=999999
               FEMME H = 1024
               FEPRIV
               MSYS H = YES
               INTCON H = YES
               SYSLOG H = YES
               EXMM H = YES
               SPCLMM H = YES
               CQ H = YES
               SNAP H = YES
               SCREECH H = YES
               TND H = YES
               END

               END
               CR :SYS,BISYNC FROM :SYS,ASYNC
               END
               CR :SYS,UNITREC FROM :SYS,ASYNC
               END
               END
 
       Remember, there must be a NETCON DEFAULT command for every handler that
       gets downline loaded later.  Also, it is imperative that NODEADMN is the
       FIRST handler defined in the BOOT INFO for the RFEP, and that HDLCX25 is
       the SECOND handler defined in the BOOT INFO for the RFEP.  If you use
       the E05 SET BOOTINFO NETCON syntax and specify TYPE=RFEP when defining
       the node, HDLCX25 will be put into the boot info for you.  See the
       sample NETCON JCL for more insight.

       _______________________       FEP MEMORY REQUIREMENTS
 
 
       Part of correctly configuring FEPs in AR5.0 consists of setting control
       parameters (with NETCON) for each FEP and each handler in each FEP.  The
       default NETCON FEP control parameters are set up to allow a FEP to boot
       and allow a small number of ASYNC lines to be used.  More complicated
       configurations require additional consideration and planning.  This
       table gives a "rule of thumb" description of how to calculate the
       appropriate control parameters on a FEP basis and a handler basis.
       (Note: in these equations, the number of devices or terminals is the
       maximum number expected to be supported at any one time.)
 
       ASYNC_MEM = 6 pages * #terminals + [if 6EDIT] 6 pages * #terminals +
            [if forms program] 12 pages * #terminals
 
       BISYNC_MEM =
           ( ( BLKBYTES from the line's PROFILE / 512 )
             + ( 5.5 * (#devices) )
             + ( 1 * (#input devices) )
             + ( (NETCON's BLOCK for the line / 256) * (#output devices) ) ) pages
              * 1 (for each RBT terminal)
             + (10 pages * #3270/7700 devices)
             + ([if forms program] 12 pages * #3270/7700  devices)
 
 
       HDLCX25_IOMEM
           = ( ( 4 + WINDOW ) * #links * #vc ) * FRAME * 2 / 512 pages
 
       HDLCX25_MEM
           = ( #links * 400 + #vc * 1200 ) / 256
             + [if 6EDIT] #x.29_circuits * 6
             + [if forms program] #x.29_circuits * 12
             + 40    pages
 
       Where #vc is the number of virtual circuits, including X.29 circuits,
       those that are defined in SUPER to support RFEPs, and those that may
       become active on link devices (e.g., X.28 circuits) (See SUPER - CREATE
       DEVICE FOR LINK).  X.29_circuits is the number of X.29 connections.
       WINDOW and FRAME are values from the link profile.  If you have links
       with different WINDOW and FRAME sizes, use IOMEM formula for each link
       separately and sum the figures up for total IOMEM. #links is the number
       of X.25 lines to run in the FEP.
 
       UNITREC_MEM = (#DEVICES * (64 + (blocking_factor * 4)))/256
               blocking_factor is the sum of the BLOCK values specified
               for the device channels, 700 by default.

                                                               YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
 
 
 
 
 
       Most of the date manipulations on CP-6, especially those of system
       processors and ghosts, involve the M$TIME monitor call. The XUD library
       routines also provide some additional support for date manipulations. A
       brief description of how M$TIME and XUD handles dates beyond year 1999
       follows. This should provide some guidelines and strategies for making
       changes in user applications as well as providing some understanding of
       how most system processors will behave when the year 2000 arrives.
 
 
 
 
 
       ______       M$TIME
 
 
 
       Date formats (such as LOCAL, ANS or EXT) have basically remained
       unchanged. The year portion of date strings, which are represented by
       two digits, will remain in a two digit form. Thus, a date in LOCAL
       format (i.e. MM/DD/YY) represented by 01/19/98 will mean Jan. 19, 1998
       and 01/19/00 will mean Jan. 19, 2000, when handled by M$TIME. The
       century is deduced by examining the value of year according to the
       following rules:
 
             00 - 20    means year 2000
             78 - 99    means year 1900
             21 - 77    undefined
 
       Note that M$TIME date strings are for input (e.g. converting a date
       string to another format), as well as output (e.g. converting some other
       format into a date string). Thus, where a CP-6 processor expects a date
       string as input, supplying a year value in the range of 00 to 20 will
       normally be the method of indicating the century to be 2000. For
       products which have been released as a new version in AR5.0, the SRBs
       may contain further details relating to Year 2000 issues.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       E05_HOST_SRB                     M$TIME                              E-1
       
 
 
       _________________       XUD DATE ROUTINES
 
 
 
       The XUD date routines provide another service for handling dates. These
       routines can deal with dates that span a greater time range than that of
       M$TIME. However, when dates containing two digit years are used as input
       to the XUD date routines (XUD$CHAR_DATE and XUD$CHAR_UTS), the century
       is assumed to be whatever the current century is at the time of the
       call. Thus the date 01/12/78 is assumed to be Jan. 12, 1978 on or before
       the year 1999 but will be assumed to be Jan. 12, 2078 after 1999.
       Because XUD is defined to behave in this time-sensitive fashion, it
       should be noted that
 
           Date calculations and comparisons may produce different (possibly
           unexpectedly) results when a program is run after 1999.
 
       Whereas the time range valid for M$TIME is roughly between 1978 and 2020
       and hence does not span more than a century, the date range for XUD can
       span more than a century and, thus, one cannot deduce the century from
       examining the year portion of the date. For such programs which require
       date ranges greater than a century, it is safest to convert them to use
       an explicit century; for example, use 1978 instead of assuming an
       implicit century (e.g. '78 or 01/01/78). For programs which use XUD but
       only use dates that lie within the valid M$TIME range (1978 to 2020), an
       option has been added to XUD routines (that deal with DATEs) to
       over-ride the default method for deducing the century.  If the bit field
       ASSUME_UTS in the XUD_PARAM parameter block is set to '1'B, the century
       will be deduced using the same rules as that of M$TIME; i.e. the century
       is 1900 if the year is between 78 and 99, century 2000 if the year is
       between 00 and 20, and for years outside the valid M$TIME range, the
       current century is assumed. The default for ASSUME_UTS is FALSE (i.e.
       '0'B).
 
 
 
 
 
       ______________       LABELLED TAPES
 
 
 
       Some changes have been made to CP-6 to properly handle labelled tapes.
       Label tapes are a potential source of year 2000 problems because they
       store file creation dates and expiry dates in two digit years. In
       addition, the date represented by Dec. 31, 1999 is used as a flag to
       mean "never" for expiry dates. Under E05, existing labelled tapes will
       be handled correctly on or beyond year 1999. The only user impact will
       be that the keyword NEVER must be used in order to specify the never
       expire date of Dec. 31 1999. Any other expiry date reference that would
       have mapped to Dec. 31 1999 will be rolled over into the next day, Jan.
       1 2000.

       ________________________________________       MAKING USER APPLICATIONS YEAR 2000 READY
 
 
 
       Some of the CP-6 products, such as ARES and ARGENT, make implicit use of
       the XUD routines to handle dates. Therefore, the assumptions made about
       the century for any dates containing two (or less) digit years will be
       the same as those of the XUD routines: to assume the century from the
       current time, i.e. the system clock. Thus, the safest, and recommended,
       approach is to explicitly use four digits for the year when dealing with
       dates for these processors.
 
       On the other hand, many processors handle dates using M$TIME. Since
       M$TIME is implicitly based on using a UTS representation (a 36-bit
       binary representation), dates represented by M$TIME do not span more
       than a century and hence the century can be deduced from a two digit
       year field.  Applications that rely only on M$TIME for date
       manipulations will not likely require any changes.
 
 
 
 
       ____________________________________________       YEAR 2000 NOTES ABOUT NON-UPDATED PROCESSORS
 
 
       The following is list of notes related to Year 2000 issues for
       processors which have not been updated for AR5.0. For those processors
       which have changed in AR5.0, refer to the product-specific SRBs for Year
       2000 notes.  The chart in Section 2-1 identifies these processors.
 
       APL (E00) is NOT year 2000 ready.  In particular, the $QTS function will
       always erroneously return a year in the twentieth century when running
       past the year 1999.
 
       ARGENT (A03) is Year 2000 ready but programs that use ARGENT may have to
       be modified so that they will continue to work into and beyond year
       2000.  In particular, many programs assume that there is an implicit
       '19' before all 2 digit year values. ARGENT actually follows (and
       documents that it follows) the current century rule. Usually expanding
       the year representation to 4 digits is sufficient to correct these
       problems.  Programmers should watch out in particular for the date value
       D'01/01/01'. This value is frequently used as a flag or special date,
       and most such uses will fail after year 2000. Programmers should also
       watch out for ARGENT programs that set the DEFAULT DATE FORMAT to a
       string that uses less than 4 digits. This will prevent the use of
       literal date values that refer to another century.

                          Notes About Non-updated Processors
       
 
 
       ARES (D02) is year 2000 ready but, because it uses XUD date routines for
       date manipulations, it assumes the current century when two digit dates
       are used.  See above section on XUD date routines for year 2000
       implications.
 
       BASIC (E01) is year 2000 ready.  However, programmers should not be
       surprised when the IDA function returns numeric values that are
       apparently less than 6 digits long on and after year 2000.  This is
       because IDA returns an integer value representing YYMMDD and numeric
       values suppress leading zeros on output.  For example, on November 13,
       2000, the numeric representation would be 001115 but will be displayed
       as 1115 since the returned value is an integer. In particular,
       converting the result of IDA to a string will likely cause problems
       since the resulting string will be of a different length on some dates
       past year 1999.
 
       PL-6 (E03) is year 2000 ready except for features that provide
       compatibility with GCOS.  No effort has been made to ensure that the
       GCOS compatibility features of PL-6 are year 2000 ready.

       Under E03 and E04, users have been running with a patch that bypasses
       this problem at the cost of performance.  The problem was found to be
       tricky to reproduce and the bug can be severe because files are
       corrupted for no apparent reason.  A source fix was made in E04 for this
       problem but it could not be tested with complete confidence.  However,
       the L66A system at Perigon Solutions had been running without the bypass
       patch for over 16 months under AR 4.0 in production without this problem
       showing up.  In addition, all AR 5.0 testing (about another 6 months)
       was performed without the bypass patch installed and the file
       inconsistency problems associated with this bug has not shown up so it
       is likely that this problem has been fixed.  AR 5.0 will still be
       released with the bypass patch in place, as a precautionary measure, due
       to the potential file system damage that could result from this bug.
       Users migrating from AR4.0 to AR5.0 are encouraged to take this
       opportunity to try running without the bypass patch.  At the same time,
       however, users are also strongly advised to take proper precautions
       (such as performing up-to-date backups) before doing so, in the unlikely
       event that the problem has not been completely fixed. Please refer to
       STAR 40367 in STARLOG on the L66A system for further instructions.
