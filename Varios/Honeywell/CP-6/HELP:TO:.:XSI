TO allows users to send messages to other online users, individually or in
groups.
TO is invoked with the command:
 
!TO[.X] who [message]
 
"Who" is the selection of users to receive the "message." Users may be selected
by sysid, user number, account, user name, ccbuf content, fep, or line.  If no
message is present, you will be prompted for lines of text to send; enter a
null line to exit.
 
Unless TO is installed in :SYS by your system manager, you must have SPCLMM and
FMSEC privileges to use TO.  Since unimportant messages can be annoying, please
don't abuse the trust shown by granting you the privileges necessary to use TO.
The user or group of users may be selected as follows.
 
ALL
        Sends to all online users.
 
n[,n ...]
        Send to users with the specified SYSIDs.  Each 'n' is a decimal number.
 
.n[,.n ...]
        Send to users with the specified user numbers.  Each 'n' is an octal
number.
 
A/CCOUNT=symbol[,symbol ...]
        Send to users with the specified accounts.
 
N/AME=symbol[,symbol ...]
        Send to users with the specified names.
 
C/CBUF=string[,string ...]
        Send to users whose CCBUF matches one of the specified strings.  If a
string is to contain a comma, blank, or right parenthisis it must be enclosed
in single quotes.
 
J/OBNAME=string[,string ...]
        Send to users whose JOBNAME matches one of the specified strings.  If a
string is to contain a comma, blank, or right parenthisis it must be enclosed
in single quotes.
 
F/EP=n[,n ...]
        Send to users on the specified FEPs.  Each 'n' is a decimal number.
 
L/INE=n-xxxx[,n-xxxx ...]
        Send to users on the specified lines.  Each 'n' is a decimal number.
Each 'xxxx' is a hexidecimal number.
 
@symbol[,symbol ...]
        Send to users at the specified Workstation Of Origin (WOO.)
 
Names, accounts, WOOs, and JOBNAME and CCBUF strings may contain the wildcard
character, '?', which will match any substring.
Examples:
   !TO ACCOUNT=?HOST Meeting in second floor conference room now!
   !TO 12345 You left your lights on
   !TO ALL Birthday cake in room 437
   !TO FEP=2 Sorry, we have to re-boot your FEP.  Please log off.
 
The message sent is formated:
   IDENT Sez: message
 
where IDENT is a label that identifies the sender in a format selected when TO
was installed on your system.  The message is equivalent to an operator SEND
keyin, and may be suppressed by the command:
   !DONT ACCEPT(SEND)
 
TO will not allow you to send to anyone with account of ZZZCUST.

CHANGES
TO is made availible to users by copying it to :SYS with appropriate account
access controls applied.  If run out of :SYS, TO requires no privilege; if run
out of another account, TO requires SPCLMM and FMSEC privileges.
 
The format of the IDENT string may be easily changed by RUM'ing the following
constant symdefs when TO is installed on your system:
   -name-       -default-  -controls-
   ID_REGISTER    '1'B     Users registered MAIL name,
                           if available.
   ID_ACCN        '0'B     Logon account name
   ID_UNAME       '0'B     User name
   ID_SYSID       '1'B     decimal SYSID
   ID_JOBNAME     '1'B     Job name (if non-blank)
   ID_WOO         '0'B     WOO (if non-blank)
 
Registered MAIL names apply only to users of CP-6 MAIL in a registered system.
If ID_REGISTER is requested and the registered name is unavailable, ACCN and
UNAME will be substituted.  Since TO cannot send a reply by registered name,
some other ID field such as SYSID should be used in addition to ID_REGISTER.
