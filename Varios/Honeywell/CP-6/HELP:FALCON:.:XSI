FALCON (Force All LowerCase Object unit Names) changes all uppercase entry
definition names in an object unit to lowercase.
Full command line syntax:
 
!FALCON.X objectname
 
where:
 
'objectname' is the name of the CP-6 object unit file.
 
 
FALCON changes uppercase object unit entry definitions to lowercase.  PL-6 and
BMAP entry names are always in uppercase regardless of how they were entered in
the sourcefile.  Identifiers are case sensitive in C and all runtime library
functions have lowercase names.  This tool is used so C programs can call PL-6
and BMAP functions without having to specify the name in uppercase, and so that
the same source file can be used to create library routines and subroutines for
all languages.
 
If the entry definition name contains a "$" the name will not be converted to
lowercase.  If the entry definition name begins with a "Z" the "Z" will be
deleted and replaced by an "_" in the new name (e.g. "ZTOOLS" -> "_tools").
 
No more help is available for FALCON.
