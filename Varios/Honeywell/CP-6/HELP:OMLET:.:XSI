OMLET expands lists maintained and created by the MAIL processor, so that
you can see who is really on a MAILing list.
To use:
 
 !MAIL
 >OUTPUT OVER data
 >DI L ?
 >END
 !OMLET.X data [OVER fid]
The OMLET tool will take a mailing list and expand it out completely.
First a data file containing the names of mailing lists needs to be
created in MAIL. Once in MAIL say OUTPUT OVER fid then enter DI L ?.
This will create a file with all global mailing lists in it. This is
the data file that OMLET uses. OMLET will output each list's name
and then list all of that list's entries. Each one of those entries
will in turn be expanded the same way. For example:
 
 Definition for LIST1
       LIST2
       LIST3
 Definition for LIST2
       LIST4
       LIST5
 Definition for LIST3
       XX
       YY
 Definition for LIST4
       AA
       BB
 Definition for LIST5
       DD
       LIST6
       EE
 Definition for LIST6
       END
 
This is the format of the file that MAIL created, and it will be
expanded out by OMLET to look like this:
 
Definition for LIST1
   LIST2
      LIST4
         AA
         BB
      LIST5
         DD
         LIST6
            END
         EE
   LIST3
      XX
      YY
 
Definition for LIST2
   LIST4
      AA
      BB
   LIST5
      DD
      LIST6
         END
      EE
 
Definition for LIST3
   etc............
