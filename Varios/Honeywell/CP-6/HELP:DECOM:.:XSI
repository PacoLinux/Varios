The DECOM program removes comments and extra spaces from files containing
DCL statements and preprocessor commands.
 
!DECOM.X si-file[,ui-file] OVER out-file  [(opt, ... opt)]
 
Options are:
   LIST - Use a list-file (F$LIST)
   NOUI - If UI file is specified but doesn't exist, don't abort
   OPTUI - If UI file is specified but doesn't exist, don't abort
 
Decommenting will normally be done on the entire file, but may
be inhibited by a record of the form:
    /* ! C ! */
Records following such a record will be copied directly to the
output file.  To turn decommenting back on:
    /* ! ! */
 
If ui-file and/or out-file does not specify a file name
(. or .acct) then the name from si-file will be substituted.
