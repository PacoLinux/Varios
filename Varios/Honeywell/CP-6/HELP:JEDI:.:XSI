Journal Entry DIsplay (JEDI) scans through any IDSII or ARES journal file and
interprets the records.  This makes it easier to track journal problems.
Invocation syntax:
 
!JEDI.X journalfid {(I/DS | A/RES)}
 
JEDI then prompts for commands; after a command is entered, JEDI sub-prompts
according to the type of primary command entered.
 
Primary commands are:
 
    R = Record range (1 to 99999999)
    D = Date & Time range (e.g. FEB 01 '85 12:00:00)
    T = Type of Record (1 to 20)
    U = User Id (0 to 9999)
    E = Exit
