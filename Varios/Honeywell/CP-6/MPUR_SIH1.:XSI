MPUR removes unwanted schema and replaced object from object and run units.
.*B*
Syntax:
.*R*
!MPUR.X #1,#2 TO/ON/OVER/INTO #3,#4
.*R*
#1 is the input FID.
.*R*
#2 is the FID selecting the schema to keep (default is ME)
.*R*
#3 is the output FID (default is OVER file#1).
.*R*
#4 is the listing FID (for reporting saved schema names).
.*B*
If #1 is an account (.acct) then the entire account will be copied (and purged)
to the account of #3, starting with the filename of #3.
 
The selection list in #2 is up-to-3-char prefixes, separated by commas, and
continued by semicolon.  If ? terminates a prefix, it will be ignored
(primarily useful when it is the only character - meaning save everything).  If
nothing can be read from #2 and it is assigned to a file, its name will be used
as a prefix (e.g. !MPUR OU,?).
 
B_DELTA is always saved.
 
If break is entered during RUN unit copy, the last listed schema selection will
be finished and the file saved. If during account copy, the current file will
be finished and saved and the copy will stop.
