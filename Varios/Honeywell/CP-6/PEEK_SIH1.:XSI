PEEK lets a user without SPY equipment list the JOB and OUTPUT
streams.
 
.*B*
PEEK output is fixed  format, written through M$LO.  The layout is
designed for an 80-character display.  The display is limited to
40 JOBs and 40 OUTPUT items.
 
To call PEEK, use either
   !PEEK.X [ (options) ]
      or
   !PRIV DISPJOB
   !PEEK.X [ (options) ]
The options are separated by commas, spaces, or nothing and may be:
  O/UTPUT  - display OUTPUT items
  J/OB     - display JOB items
  M/Y      - display only my items
  D/ISPJOB - get DISPJOB privilege (if I have it) and display
             everyone's items
If no options are specified, OUTPUT and JOB are assumed.  MY is
assumed if DISPJOB privilege is not on.
 
.*B*
The JOB display includes JOBNAME (.ACCT if DISPJOB is on),
and flags to indicate ACCOUNT, ORDER, DEFER, RERUN, and FOLLOW.
If the JOB is being rerun, the SYSID is followed by 'R'.  The
column called 'TIME' indicates ELAPSED CPU/MAX CPU, where ELAPSED
is only an estimate,  calculated as (TIME_NOW - START_TIME)/ETMF.
 
The OUTPUT display appends a suffix to SYSID indicating the mode
of the user who created the output (I,B,G,T).
