COMP compares a new file with an old file and generates the plus-card update
file needed to create a new update file.
 
Invocation:
 
     !COMP.X old,new {ON|OVER} update
 
where:
 
     old    is the FID of the old file (DCB=M$SI),
     new    is the FID of the new file (DCB=M$UI), and
     update is the FID of the generated update file (DCB=M$OU).
 
     The new and/or update file names may be colons, indicating that the old
     file name is to be used.  For this purpose, an asterisk (indicating a
     temporary file) is not considered to be part of the file name.
 
COMP compares the new and old files by key.  If either is not a keyed file, it
is treated as if it had sequential integer keys.  Keys other than EDIT keys are
not accepted.  For two records to match, the keys, the data, and the length
must be the same, except that trailing blanks are ignored.  The update file
will be keyed so that its data records have the same keys as the corresponding
lines of the new file, insofar as this is possible.
 
If the old file does not exist, the update file will be set up to create the
new file from nothing.  If the new file does not exist, the update file will be
set up to delete every record of the old file.
 
The old and new files are read sequentially.  The update file is written
randomly, i.e., the plus-card records are written after the data records.

Compares a new file with an old file and generates the plus-card updates
needed to transform the old file to the new file.  This program, unlike
CMPR, compares on EDIT KEYS, not record content.
