FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=80)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

TIDY reformats FORTRAN programs for better readability.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
      !TIDY.X source_file OVER output_file [(options)]
 
.*B*
where
 
source_file         is the file to be tidied.
.*R*
output_file         is a file to put the tidied output into.
 
options:
 
(NOX|ORX) - ignore any C*X* comments in source
 
IFX       - format source only if it contains C*X* comments
 
X         - prompt me for default C*X* formatting options (Formatting options
may also be specified on the command line instead of being specified
separately.)
 
CYR [=year] - year is the digit string indicating the year (A. D.) to be
included in the C*T* copyright notice inserted wherever a C*T* comment is found
in the source.  If the year string is not specified then the current year will
be included in the C*T* copyright notice.

TIDY is a program for formatting FORTRAN programs with the goal of producing a
more readable program.  The transformations performed by TIDY are fairly simple
and do not affect the program flow or logic in any way.  Things done by TIDY to
improve program readability include
 
1)  Indenting statements within DO loops and block IF statements.
 
2)  Renumbering statement labels so that they increase in even increments
moving down the side of the page.
 
3)  Sorting variable names alphabetically in a declaration statement
(optional).
.*B*
TIDY should be able to handle any FORTRAN program that can be compiled with the
CP-6 FORTRAN compiler.
 
TIDY is primarily intended for processing programs that are syntactically
correct (ie. that compile with no errors) but if this is not the case TIDY can
detect and report such errors as missing labels and unbalanced block IF
statements.
 
There are certain restrictions on the size of programs that TIDY can handle.
There can be no more than 512 labels in one routine. There can be no more than
400 forward references in a routine.  A single statement cannot contain more
than 4000 characters excluding blanks at the start and end of each line.
.*B*
The contents of source files may be affected by the formatting options
described below.  These options may be contained within C*X* commentary, given
when prompted for (see (X) command line options above), or on the command line
itself.  The syntax of of these options is:
 
          option [,option]  ...
 
Each option is one of two types.  The first type, if specified, tells TIDY that
you want this option.  If not specified, TIDY assumes that you do not want this
option done.  The syntax for this type of option is:
 
          option-name
 
The second type of option specifies a numeric value:
 
          option-name = value
 
The value must be specified.
 
If an unrecognizable option-name is used, TIDY gives an error message and
quits.
.*B*
The following options are presently available.
 
PD    Reformats declaration statements by sorting the variable names
alphabetically and printing them out one per line.  If this option is used the
SD option cannot be used.
 
SD    Reformats declaration statements by sorting the variable names
alphabetically.  Unlike the PD option, more than one variable is placed per
line.  If this option is used the PD option cannot be used.
 
HF    "Hold Formats".   Normally TIDY moves FORMAT statements down to just
before the END statement.  This option tells TIDY to leave FORMAT statements
where they are found.
 
 
JR     "Justify Right".  Normally TIDY puts labels starting in column 1.  This
option forces the labels to be justified so that the last digit in the label
falls in column 5.
.*B*
IND/ENT = nn
          specifies that the indentation for DO loops and IF THEN constructs
will be nn spaces.  The default will be 0.  The default will be assumed if this
option is not specified.
 
STMT = nnnnn
          specifies the starting label in a program or subroutine to be nnnnn.
The default will be 1000.
 
FMT = nnnnn
          specifies the starting FORMAT statement label to be nnnnn.  The
default will be 9000.
 
SINC = nnn
          specifies that the increment for statment labels will be nnn.  The
default will be 10.
 
FINC = nnn
          specifies that the increment for FORMAT statement labels will be nnn.
The default will be 10.
.*B*
NOTES:
.*R*
TIDY does not do any forward checking to insure that the statement labels and
FORMAT labels do not overlap.
 
At the start of each individual program element, i.e.  Main, subroutine,
function the starting label and starting FORMAT label are reset to the STMT and
FMT values.
