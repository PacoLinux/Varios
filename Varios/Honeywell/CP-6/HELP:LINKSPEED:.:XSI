LINKSPEED moves meaningless data records back and forth from FPRGs in a
selected FEP in order to test the FPRG-to-host data rate and connection.
Use LINKSPEED as follows:
 
!LINKSPEED.acct FEnn (options)
 
where:
 
FEnn
      specifies the FEP in which LINKSPEED_FP is to be run to transmit data.
It must be specified, and must be specified numerically.
 
 
Options are: RCVONLY, TIME=secs, SIZE=bufbytes, FPRGS=n
 
Type ? for full options explanation.
options are any of:
 
RCVONLY
      specifies that only FEP-to-HOST traffic is to be used.
 
TIME=s
      specifies that the run is to last "s" seconds, and then is to terminate
automatically.  Only one summary line is produced in this case.  The default is
zero, which means that the run continues until terminated by an interactive
command, and the summary line is updated continuously at approximately
one-second intervals.
 
SIZE=n
      specifies that "n" bytes of data are to be transmitted at a time.  The
default is 1024.
 
FPRGS=n
      specifies that "n" FPRGs are to be run simultaneously.  More than one is
normally required to fully load a link, because the program-to-program
communication protocol is half-duplex.  The default is 1.
LINKSPEED moves meaningless data records back and forth from FPRGs in a
selected FEP.  It calculates from the amount of data moved an approximation of
the effective speed of the connection between the Host and the FEP.  Both the
number of FPRGs running and the size of the records being transmitted are
adjustable to facilitate optimum loading of the link.
 
When invoked without the TIME option,  LINKSPEED will immediately start
updating a summary line, approximately once per second.  Over-write VFC is
used, so for hardcopy terminals, the TIME option should be used.  A number of
single-character commands are also available when the TIME option is not used,
most of them duplicating functions available through the options:
 
"+" and "-"
      change the number of Fprgs being used, in the indicated direction.  The
number can be varied between one and ten.
 
"<" and ">"
      change the size of data being transmitted by a factor of 2, in the
indicated direction.  The size can be varied between 16 and 4096.
 
For convenience, these two commands can be entered in "lower-case" on many
keyboards, as "," and ".", respectively.
 
More...
 
BEL (CNTL-G)
     toggles the "audio-visual" mode, wherein each summary line update is
accompanied by a BEL character, so that tests of link durability can be
monitored aurally.
 
"q", "Q", or "0"
     terminates the LINKSPEED run.  A final summary line is produced,
indicating the average data transfer rate for the entire period of operation.
 
LINKSPEED uses a FPRG called LINKSPEED_FP, which must be in the same account
that LINKSPEED is fetched from.
