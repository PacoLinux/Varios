There are two types of application packages of interest to CP-6 users:
 
1.  Those that are running on CP-6 and are available (free or for a price).
 
2.  Those that someone wants to have available on CP-6.
 
The second type constitutes a search for applications that may be available
somewhere, applications that are running on some other system that may be
converted easily, or a search for someone willing to convert or help convert
some package.  The database for cataloging the first type is a HELP file APPS.
The method of searching for the second type is a DABBLE.X electronic meeting,
APPS_WANTED (both are on the LADC CP-6 Support System).

Description:
 
IFPS (Interactive Financial Planning System) is an interactive business
modeling package used worldwide for planning, modeling, and decision support.
The system is flexible and comprehensive, yet its nonprocedural syntax makes
it uniquely easy to use.
 
Applications range from simple department budgets to multicurrency corporate
consolidations.
 
Because the factors affecting planning and decision making are constantly
changing, the IFPS Model subsystem is designed to help the user quantify
variables and understand their relationships to each other.  A typical model
describes how each variable is expected to change over time.
 
Models may be developed or shared by several users, possibly working in
different departments or cities.  Each person's work is easily understood by
the others because IFPS Models are written in familiar business terms,
variable relationships are explicitly stated, and the model listings
themselves are the documentation.
 
Some specific analysis features of the Model subsystem: WHAT IF?  allows the
user to see the results of alternative scenarios.  GOAL SEEKING is used to
determine values of variable when a desired goal is known.  SENSITIVITY
permits varying a variable over a range of values to determine its effect on
other variables.  IMPACT changes several variables, one at a time, to show
their effects on one particular variable.
 
Other IFPS subsystems and their functions are Report (defines report formats
and contents), Datafile (creates and updates data for input to models),
Command File (directs execution of a series of models/reports), Formula
(creates user-defined modeling functions), and Structure (creates and executes
directives to perform complex consolidations for a multidivision
organization).

personal data bases, provides circulation backup, supports ALA and foreign
character sets, and incorporates commodity PC software such as spreadsheets,
word processors, and graphics.
 
LIAS excells in university and college, research, and public libraries.  LIAS
is particularily adept at handling multiple or consortium libraries using
union catalogs.  LIAS supports full LC MARC records format.  LIAS will support
the LSP/SNI networking protocol when it is fully defined.  Also, MicroLIAS
will provide online cataloging to utilities such as OCLC, RLIN, WLN, and
Faxon.
 
LIAS is written in PL-6 and uses IDS-II.  MicroLIAS is written in C and runs
on PC/DOS or MS/DOS.

The Model Profile Analysis (MPA) identifies and cross-validates relatively
homogeneous subgroups with a dimensional or ordination space, directed to
large samples in a multiple replication design; strategy is based on the
following:
 
1.  Identification of preliminary types within several samples.
 
2.  Replication of these types across samples.
 
3.  Generalizability of the final typology to new groups of subjects.
 
This strategy allows differentiation of independent contribution of elevation,
scatter, and shape parameters in definition of profile similarity.

PALUS is a productivity tool to be used in both the office environment and/or
wherever there is a terminal and a modem.  In the office it can be used by a
computer programmer for the entry and maintenance of computer data and
programs.  It can also be used by the staff for documentation preparation and
general correspondence.
 
PALUS combines the power and flexibility of the CP-6 operating system with the
familiarity of micro based wordprocessing packages.  This combination
minimizes the need for education or anyone who is familiar with wordprocessing
on a micro and also removes many of the restrictions that micros have by using
the power and size of the CP-6 environment.
 
PALUS provides you with "the what you see is what you get" screen display
which is a MUST for anyone who is serious about designing page layouts.  This
allows you to see margins, line spacings, indents, and layout of paragraphs.
 
PALUS is like the assistant that you always wanted.  It will do some things
automatically for you and other things under your control and settings.  One
of the automatic features is instant formatting which is done transparently as
you type.  Unless otherwise specified, PALUS uses default settings to
determine the following:
 
    -   left and right margins
    -   paragraph indentation
    -   tab settings both fixed and variable
    -   line spacing
 
You can adjust and set these settings either directly by entering data values,
or in most cases by cursor positioning or line example.
 
This screen oriented system allows for cursor movement in the following
directions:
 
    -   left     (character, word, and line)
    -   right    (character, word, and line)
    -   up       (line and screen)
    -   down     (line and screen)
    -   document (top and bottom)
 
You may also delete text by character, word, line, or block.
 
Block functions include block marking, moving, copying, and deleting of
blocks.  The perimeter of the blocks can be visible or invisible to the user,
thus allowing for easy verification and yet not distorting the reality of the
screen display.
 
Advance page formatting features include text centering, right end
justification either on or off, and setting the margins from the text.
 
Advanced editing features include user markers and the UNDO commands which
allows the user to recover from the mistaken editing of a line (to return to
the before image).
 
Standard printing functions include underline, super, and subscripts as well
as user defined printer codes.
 
Since PALUS uses standard CP-6 system keyed-files, PALUS files can be used by
other applications and keyed-files can also be read into PALUS as both
separate documents or merged into existing documents.  PALUS files are also
candidates for the extensive security and backup facilities available in CP-6
without having to to ANYTHING special.
 
Future versions of PALUS will include such features as a:
 
    -   calculator mode
    -   user macros
    -   user stored phrases

Description:
 
A system independent application is available that allows a user to create JCL
and files necessary to RUM the system processors and FEP's before the boot
process.  As a result of moving the RUM process out of boot time, a site can
expect a 70% reduction in the time necessary to boot up.  In addition to
RUMing, the JCL checks the RUMing of both the processors and FEP's for errors
that are not normally reported during a system boot so that a user can detect
patch syntax problems before actually having to boot a system.

PROLOG is a predicate logic language.  PROLOG programs are formatted as sets
of facts and rules, using non-algorithmic program representation.  It allows
programmers to work from descriptive rather than prescriptive viewpoint, which
differs greatly from Basic and COBOL.  PROLOG is considered to be a fifth
generation language (heavily used in Japan), and is used to construct expert
systems.
Comments:
 
Reference book is "Programming PROLOG" by W. F. Clocksin and C. S.  Mellish,
1981

QAD is an interactive application development tool with its own database and
automated development support environment.  QAD generates COBOL programs,
improving the flexibility and versatility of COBOL without imposing
compromises or limitations on the user.
 
In QAD, data dictionary, relational databases, data retrieval and presentation
facilities, utilities and program generators are completely integrated to
create a comprehensive, efficient and flexible development tool that is also a
very powerful maintenance facility.
 
QAD is a valuable tool for any programmer, regardless of experience and level
of skill.  With QAD, a novice can write programs that are beyond his
capability with conventional tools.  An expert can make efficient use of the
automatic facilities and combine them with his own code to create high quality
programs in a fraction of the time that would be required otherwise.
 
QAD relieves programmers from most of the boring and time consuming tasks
associated with COBOL and lets them devote their time and effort to move
creative activities.
 
Applications developed with QAD are machine independent.  Applications can be
generated on one computer and then transferred to another type of computer.

*STATISTICS
Description:
 
STATUS is an Information Storage and Retrieval System which allows the user to
capture, store, up-date and retrieve large quantities of textual and numeric
information.  It is easy to use, designed for the inquirer and the computer
specialist.  Installation is rapid and takes up the minimum time of scarce
programmers.  STATUS can be 'built-in' to existing total information systems.
 
The main core of STATUS is its database, which comprises two major components:
a text file and a concordance file. The text file is a continuous stream of
text as inserted by the user.  All input text is structured into four levels:
Chapter; Article; Paragraph; Word. These levels are chosen to suit the nature
of the information in the text. The concordance file is a structured list of
all words used in the vocabulary of the text file, together with pointers to
the places in which they occur in the text (using the four levels). The user
may input a list of 'Common Words' which are not included within the
concordance.  The choice of a suitable list of frequently used words, e.g.,
'the', 'of', 'and', which are not useful search terms, can considerably reduce
the size of the concordance.
 
All database searches are initiated by the user-entered question. A simple
question may contain a single search term (a word, truncated word or phrase)
and the search will identify all articles containing that term.  Logical
operators can be used to link several terms specifying the relationships
between them.  To aid complex searches, where long questions have to be
specified, or frequently re-used, 'Macro' and 'Synonym' features are provided.
 
Text in a database may be assigned security keys at the chapter level, article
level and, where required, at named section level.

Description:
 
Stanford University Process Analysis (SUPRA) is an IC process analysis
package.  It allows the user to obtain the two-dimensional doping profiles
which result from ion implantation and/or redistribution of impurities during
high temperature processing.  SUPRA can simulate ion implantation through any
arbitrary mask structure or boron, phosphorus, and arsenic impurities.
Oxidation can be simulated on a restricted set of device structures.  One of
the most powerful aspects of SUPRA is the combination of analytic and
numerical solution methods into one program.  Capabilities are provided for
obtaining two-dimensional contour plots or impurity concentrations.  Also,
one-dimensional plots can be made of impurity concentration versus distance
along arbitrary straight line paths through the device.  These high-quality
plots can be obtained on a variety of graphics terminals, which are supported
by GKS on CP-6.

processing steps that can be modeled are:  inert ambient drive-in, oxidation
of silicon and silicon-nitride, ion implantation, epitaxial growth of silicon
and low temperature disposition or etching of various materials.  A nice
feature of this program is that it allows plotting of the impurity
concentrations versus depth, not only on the lineprinter, but also on a
variety of graphics devices supported by GKS.

Description:
 
UCIFMIS is a collection of processors that allow foreign mail interface to
CP-6 mail.  Processors are included that allow CP-6 Mail deposited in the
output queue to a remote site to be moved to a processing FMA, and converted
from the CP-6 internal mail format to ASCII RFC733/822 files.  These resulting
ASCII mail messages may then be transported to other systems, using a
mechanism such as PMDF.  Another processor takes incoming RFC733/822 ASCII
mail messages in a queue FMA, converts them to the internal CP-6 mail format,
and stores them for delivery by CP-6 MAILMAN.

UCI is not in a position to formally support CP-6 UCIFMIS, but informal
support is no problem.  For further information, contact Dana Roode:
 
    Internet:  DFROODE%UCICP-6.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU
               Roode@ICS.UCI.EDU
    BITNET:    DFROODE@UCICP-6
    LADC CP-6: UCI@LADC
 
To obtain the UCIFMIS processors as load modules that work under C00 or C01
CP-6 and A01 or A02 MAIL, send UCI the following:
 
o   A check for $400 to cover distribution costs.  Check should be made out to
    the "Regents of the University of California".
 
o   Proof that the requestor has a CP-6 MAIL license from Honeywell.
 
o   A signed copy of UCI's license agreement (available on request).
 
UCI's postal address is:

UCIFMIS source files are included on the UCIFMIS distribution tape.  Two of
the three FMIS processors require Honeywell MAIL routines and INCLUDE files to
be re-compiled or re-loaded.  These routines are only available through
Honeywell via purchasing a MAIL source license.
