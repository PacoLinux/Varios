WOCKY is a tool which prints what you type.  Not useful, unless you want to
know what that "F1" key on your terminal is sending to CP-6.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!WOCKY.X
 
WOCKY will prompt with a ~ (tilde) and will print back the ASCII values for
what you type at this point.  If the character is transmitted with the parity
bit set, the interpretation of the character will be followed by the characters
'[P]'.  To bail out, hit BREAK *or* type 5 of the same character in a row
without any different intervening characters.
