USERS converts user records from D00 :USERS and :HLP files to E00
user records.
 
!USERS.X
 
It uses the following DCBs:
 
 M$SI = D00 :USERS file; :USERS.:SYS.
 M$UI = D00 :HLP file; :HLP.:SYS
 M$OU = E00 :USERS file; named *USERS (converted).
 M$LO = E00 :HLP file; named *HLP (converted).
 
 The "account, name" of the converted :USERS will be listed
 through M$DO.
 
**Note**  The :PROJ file should be just copied over from
          D00 to E00.
CAUTION:--- There are records other than user definitions which
            reside in the :HLP file.  Is is recommended that these
            other records be removed before conversion is begun.
            Type HELP (USERS.X) HLP or a '?' for how to do this.
The following JCL and program run create a copy of :HLP which will
contain only records pertaining to users.
!C :HLP.:SYS (SH) OVER *
!COPYPGM.X * OVER **HLP
IF 1='001'O
COPY ASIS
KEY IN
GO
 
The file **HLP contains the copy of :HLP with records for users only.

Modified to convert D00 -> E00 :USERS and :HLP.
Folded the functionality of PQ0 into USERS.
Zeroed or blank padded all * fields in the USERS structure.
Blank padded the PROFILE field of :HLP records.
Zeroed the unused portion of the FEPRIV section of :HLP records.
Zeroed the new security fields of :USERS.
09/25/84
Fixed code to close holes in the resource array if a resource was
deleted from the middle of the list.  This previously caused a memory
fault.
6/29/84 5:23.03
Made users recognize resources whose max limit for all for modes was
zero and delete these resources from an individual users resource
list.  This is compatable with the new actions of SUPER for C00.
Also made users initialize some fields for C00 security.
5/31/84 9:52.26
Fixed help file to tell how to remove records from :HLP which don't
pertain to users.
02/23/84 11:42.17
Force is in to make setup fields user alterable on converted records.
11/10/83 11:46.30
Adjusted for new user record using fixed size and bannertext fields.
10/11/83
Changed to B03->C00 version.
CHANGES
The :HLP file has not only user definitions, but some device
info too.  It is suggested to use the JCL to get a copy of the
:HLP file which will only have copies of the users records.
 
!C :HLP.:SYS (SH) OVER *
!COPYPGM.X * OVER **HLP
IF 1='001'O
COPY ASIS
KEY IN
GO
 
**HLP now contains the records to be run through USERS.X.
