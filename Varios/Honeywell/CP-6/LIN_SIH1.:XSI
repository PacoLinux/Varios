   LIN saves typing when making updates to existing source in UI files.
It copies a record or sequence of records from the base file into the update
file at lines n.1 to n.n and puts an appropriate plus-card at n.0.
 
   !LIN.X [basefile].baseaccount,.updateaccount [(comment[)]]
 
.*B*
LIN will then prompt for input, which is of several sorts:
   1. A number or two separated by ., -, ,, or / will make an update packet.
   2. A number before or after a ., -, ,, or / will make a plus card (only).
   3. X or Q will return to IBEX.
   4. E, 6[E], or P[E] edits the update file using EDIT, 6EDIT, or PULSE.
   5. EX, 6[E]X, or P[E]X examines the base file using EDIT, 6EDIT, or PULSE.
   6. M[ODMOVE] (anystuff.. invokes MODMOVE with "anystuff.." as CCBUF.
   6.5 M[ODMOVE] cmnd invokes MODMOVE to do "cmnd file.uiaccount".
   7. C=anything will change the comment to anything.
   8. A name containing any character greater than ? will change basefile.
   9. K [anystuff] will call KEYUP.X file.uiaccount [(anystuff)]
   10. !anystuff - will call IBEX to do "anystuff".
The generated plus-cards will contain the date, the user's initials if they
can be determined from B$JIT.ACCN (see below), and # followed by comment from
the command line or the last C= line (??? if no comment is present).
The update file is opened CREATE,OLDFILE. All records are written with NEWKEY
enforced.
To change the SI or UI account, use the IBEX ADJUST command after returning
from EDIT or any non-numeric thing.
User initials are determined from B$JIT.ACCN by finding the best wildcard
match from a list of patterns contained in LIN, and using the remaining
characters of B$JIT.ACCN.  For example, with a pattern of :SYS?, a user logged
on as :SYSTAC would get the initials TAC.  The list of eight character patterns
is in the 40-element array, ID_PATTERNS.  The count of patterns to use is in
ID_PATTERN_COUNT.  These items should be patched to customize LIN for your
installation.
