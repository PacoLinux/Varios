       11       11                   This module contains all of the constant and static data used by
       12       12                   memory management.
       13       13             DESCRIPTION:
       14       14                   This is a data only module. It contains definitions of statistical
       15       15                   and control data used by LCP-6 memory management. Items
       16       16                   initialized to 32768 and ADDR (ERASE) are initialized
       17       17                   elsewhere.
