FINK (File INternals made Known) displays a file's internal information, like
the FIT codes array, the different codes, granule headers, and granules.
Syntax: !FINK.X sifid [{TO|ON|OVER|INTO} , lofid] [(option-list[)]]
 
sifid = File to be analyzed.
lofid = Listing output file name.
 
Option-list = Any of the options (including none) separated by commas.
 
After the command line Option-list is executed, FINK will prompt with
 
FINK>>
 
At this point any Option-list option may be entered with delimited parenthesis
being optional.
 
Type HELP (FINK.X) OPTIONS.

   ALL:        AL/L
 
Displays the header of the current granule, the FIT codes array, and all the
codes.
 
BLINK
BLINK:      BL/INK
 
Changes the current granule to the granule specified by the Backward Link.
 
88/06/21
       - Added the KEY and KEYTBL commands, and taught FINK about files
         stowed on optical disk.
88/05/13  FEM
       - Added the SHARE command.  (And I needed it, too!)
87/09/18  FEM
       - Added CODE18, CODE19, and CODE20.
87/09/09  FEM
       - Added the IRKEYS command.
87/07/27  FEM
       - Made FINK use UBLOCK access when we don't have FMSEC.
86/10/10
       - Reflect D00 changes in the CODE05 (backup) and CODE06 (STOW)
         FIT code structures.
85/07/11
       - Added CODE 17. (VLP_FPRG)
85/06/21
       - Fixed to allow tape opens.
85/05/16
       - When opening a STOWed INACTIVE file. FINK now allows you
         to display code 06 which is the only code returned in the
         FPARAM buffer.
85/05/08
       - Fields with information that can not be seen by a user
         w/out FMSEC are blanked out.

Installed in LADC X account.
CODEn:      [DI/SPLAY] [CODE] n
    where n is the code number.
 
Displays the specified code structure.
 
CHANGES
DA:         DA gnum
 
Disk Address changes the current granule to that specified by gnum.  gnum is
the granule number. It can be a decimal or octal number.  If octal a period (.)
must preceed the number.
 
DUMP:       DU/MP [n]
 
This option will dump the contents of the current granule.  If n is specified,
n number of words will be dumped.
 
END:       E/ND X/IT Q/UIT
 
Returns to IBEX.
 
FILE:       Same as OPEN
 
FIT:        [DI/SPLAY] FIT
 
Displays the Fit codes array.
 
FLINK
FLINK:      FL/INK
 
Changes the current granule to the granule specified by the Forward Link.
 
HEADER
HEADER:     [DI/SPLAY] H/EADER
 
Displays the header of the current granule.  Current granule may be changed by
using the FLINK, BLINK, and DA commands.
 
IRKEYS:     IR/KEYS
 
Displays the IRKEYS structure in the read-only segment, for IREL files.
 
KEY:        K/EY n
 
Displays the FM$KEYENT structure for the specified key in the current granule.
The "n" parameter is used as an index into the key table.
 
KEYTBL:     K/EY T/BL (abbreviation:  KT)
 
Performs a KEY command for each key in the key table.
 
NXTA:       NXTA [SN=sn]
 
Specifies that the user wants to access a different account from the PAD if SN
is specified or from the MAD if SN is not specified. FINK will obtain the
account name following the  account specified in the DCB and then will change
the DCB to reflect this change.
 
NXTF:       NXTF [(srchcond)]
 
Opens the next file in the account directory.
 
srchcond is a mask of bits that are used to select what files are to be found.
srchcond can be any of the following:
 
ANYF      ARCHIVE        BAD            BUF
DELF      NOLIST         QS             REV
 
For a complete description of these options, please refer to the Monitor
Services Manual.
 
OPEN
OPEN:       OP/EN sifid
 
The open option will open a new sifid.
 
Type 'HELP option' for a description of the option.
 
Legal options are
 
OPEN           FILE           THISF
NXTF           NXTA           REPORT

REPORT
REPORT:     RE/PORT [format]
 
Report will display the current format for numerical output.  This format may
be changed by specifying one of the "format" options.
 
format can be  O/CTAL, D/ECIMAL, H/EXADECIMAL, or B/INARY.
 
In order to be able to display all of the possible information in the FIT,
FMSEC privilege is needed.  If the user doesn't have FMSEC privilege, the FLINK
and BLINK commands may not be used before issuing a DA command, as the granule
header isn't returned with the FIT.  In addition, when examining a compressed
file, only the FIT may be displayed.
SHARE:      SHARE [option]
 
Sets SHARE for the next OPEN/FILE command.
 
Valid options are ALL, IN, or NONE.  SHARE with no options prints the current
SHARE setting.
THISF:      Prints the name of the file currently opened.
