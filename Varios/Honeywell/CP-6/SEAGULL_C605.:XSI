/*P*    NAME:     SEAGULL_C65
        PURPOSE:  This file contains "stolen" code (shhhhh).  It was
                  borrowed directly from the B00 C compiler accounts.
                  The routines within serve as an XUU interface.
 
        DESCRIPTION:
          The extractable comments were kept in tact for all the
          functions, so have a look below for any details needed.
          The comments not needed for extraction were changed as
          follows:  *M* -> *zbM*, etc.

/*B*  NAME:    SG5$FILEINFO
      PURPOSE: This structure contains the entire interface to
               the ZB_INPUT$? routines (SEAGULL_SI605, SG5_?).
               This structure must match the equivalent C stucture:
               zb_input$inp_types:h (SEAGULL_Cc04, SG4_files).
      DESCRIPTION:
         BUFFER$  ptr   - Points at a buffer that is to receive
                          a record of data from SG5_INPUT_READ
         BUFSIZE  sbin  - The size of the buffer that BUFFER$
                          points at
         NBYTES   sbin  - Number of bytes read by SG5_INPUT_READ
         FILETYPE sbin  - The type of file to open, read, or close
                           =1 Base file
                           =2 Update file
                           =3 Include file
         FILENAME$ ptr  - A pointer to the name of the file to
                          be opened
         OPEN_FLAG sbin - Is the file open
                           =0 No the file is not open
                           =1 Yes the file is open
         LEVEL sbin     - The nested level of the include files
         OPTUI sbin     - Is the UI file optional
         LIST_UPDATE  sbin   - Write UI file at the beginning of LO
         KEY  ptr       - points to the key number of the file being read
         SI_FID$  ptr   - points to a source file name to be put into
                          the M$SI DCB for the XUU$OPEN call.  This
                          facility is used when SI is not on command line.
         UI_FID$  ptr   - points to update file name and/or account, and
                          is used similarly to SI_FID$.
         OU_FID$  ptr   - points to object file name, and ditto.
