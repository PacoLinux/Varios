CONSOLE gives a batch, ghost, or timesharing user access to console facilities.
.*B*
Syntax: !CONSOLE [name[,,pass]] [(keyin)]
 
Where
       name    is the name of a SUPER-defined console device
       pass    is the password of the console device
       keyin   is a keyin used for "one shot" keyins
 
If a null keyin is given (e.g. "!CONSOLE ()"), CONSOLE will prompt again for
the command line.  Using this option will prevent console logons from showing
up in CCBUF where casual ANLZ SPYs can see them.
.*B*
CONSOLE starts an fprg that logs on to a console device.  To enter commands,
press BREAK.  CONSOLE passes all console output to the user's terminal unless a
"oneshot' keyin is given.  Inputting of <ESC><F> terminates CONSOLE.  If the
optional keyin is specified, it will be issued and the program will exit
without displaying anything.  The "name" and "pass" parameters can be used to
log on a console other than the default. The "oneshot" keyin method is the
recommended technique for batch and ghost users.  For info about console
logons, see

!HELP (CONSOLE.X) DEFAULT
.*B*
Although written to be used with a console, CONSOLE can just as easily connect
to any comgroup terminal station.
.*K* DEFAULTS
There are two RUMable fields in CONSOLE that control the default console logon.
These are DEFAULT_NAME, and DEFAULT_PASS.  These are initially set to spaces,
so any site wishing to use CONSOLE with a default console logon must RUM these
to the appropriate values.  At LADC, we RUM our values into console on its way
to :SYS.
 
For example, if you had a console device named "CONSOLE" with a password of
"PASS", the following would make CONSOLE,,PASS the default console device.
 
   !RUM CONSOLE.X
   >M DEFAULT_NAME 'CONS'
   >M DEFAULT_NAME+1 'OLE '
   >M DEFAULT_PASS 'PASS'
.*K* SECURITY
Obviously unrestricted use of this program can be disasterous to system
security.  It is recommended that this program be controlled with access
controls or locks if the program is RUMed with a default console.  If a site
does not want this program active, it can be left as-is in the X account
without RUMming a default console logon, and it will pose no security threat.
.*K* CONSOLE_FPRG
CONSOLE_FPRG is the fprg that CONSOLE uses to connect into the comgroup.  It is
automatically fetched from the same account from which the CONSOLE run-unit was
fetched.  It is downloaded into the local fep through which the user running
CONSOLE is currently connected.
