FICHER is a program that takes listing and source files and
creates a set of tapes for printing on microfiche.  The tapes
are free-format, of the following form:
    1600 bpi
    recl=133,blkl=3990
    Byte zero of each record is a '1' if this record is to be
      at the beginning of a fiche frame, else it should be ' '.
    63 lines per frame.
    Module names must be at a fixed place, currently column 103.

    F$LIST    List file
    F$FILE    Listing account

List file:
 
    The list file is of the format:
 
              filename,header-type,vfc-type
 
    Header-type indicates the type of formatting to be applied
    to header lines.  See HEADING command.
 
    Vfc-type indicates what kind of VFC the file has:
 
        CP6   CP6 unit record file
        CPV   Vfc of '1' indicates top of page, all other vfc
              characters are ignored.
        PCL   Get the file from M$SI and M$UI, create listing
              with the keys of the input files.
 
There are two classes of commands - those that set defaults and
describe how an operation is to be performed, and those that cause
an operation to commence.  Commands from the first group may
be specified in any order.  Only one from the last group may be
specified, and it must be last.
 
Class 1 commands:
 
    PLA/TEN [ W/IDTH = n ]  [, L/ENGTH = m ]
 
        Sets the width and length of the microfiche frame.
 
    FIL/ENAME [AT] n
 
        Specifies the column # at which the file name is to
      appear.  Default is 103.  The name is preceeded by the
      string ' FILE=' and followed by a blank.
 
    RESTART [=] name
 
        Indicates that a run is to be restarted with the file
      after 'name'.  If LAST is specified, restarts with
      the last file that was successfully written.
 
    HEADING  header-type [mod-cmnd, ... ]
 
        Specifies the modification that is to be performed for
      various kinds of headers.  header-type is a 1 to 12
      character name that appears in the list file.  The various
      types of mod-cmnd are:
 
          DATE [AT] column#
 
              Puts date (MON DD 'YY) at specified column.
 
          TIME [AT] column#
 
              Puts time at specified column.
 
          PAGE [AT] column#
 
              Specifies the column at which the page number is
            to be placed.  Each frame has a page number - either
            at the default location (122) or the one specified here.
 
          MOVE n FROM col1 TO col2
 
              Moves the n character string beginning at col1
            to col2.
 
          'string' [AT] column#
 
              Inserts the specified string at column#.
 
    REPORT
 
        Causes all files to be listed as they are encountered.  The
      default is to only list errors.
 
 
Class 2 commands.  Only one may be specified.  GO is the default:
 
    LIST
 
        Indicates that a set of tapes is to be listed.
 
    PRINT
 
        Same as LIST except prompt for a list of file names.  When
        the name is found on the tape, print it through M$LP.
 
    CHECK
 
        Same as GO except don't write tapes.  Used to find out what
        files don't exist, and if there are any errors in the
        HEADING commands.
 
    GO
 
        Start writing tape.
