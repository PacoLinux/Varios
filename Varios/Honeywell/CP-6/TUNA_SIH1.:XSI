FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.
.*R*
.*A*
TUNA can TUNE-A CAP or TEXT input file so that it is more easily edited with
the CP-6 editors.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!TUNA.X text_file [OVER output_file] [(options)]
 
where:
 
 text_file is a TEXT input file containing TEXT directives
 output_file is an optional place to put the TUNAed output
 
Options are: RECSIZE=nnn, SENTENCES, PRUNE, CDC, 6EDIT, MAXCOMPRESS, NUSBS,
NSUMM and NWARN.
.*B*
Here are detailed descriptions of the options and their actions.
 
LEN/GTH=line_length  or
.*R*
WID/TH=line_length   or
.*R*
RECS/SIZE=line_length
          Sets the size of the records that TUNA produces.  The default is 69,
range is 20 - 2047.  Try to stay less than 255, though.
 
SENT/ENCES
          Begin each sentence on a new line.  Sentences end in the characters
":?!." followed by two spaces.
 
PRUNE | STRIP
          Won't let "." records thru to the output file.
 
HELP | HERMAN
          Formats the output, honoring .INL and .UNL commands, creating a
CONSEC output file, stripped of all TEXT commands, but not TEXT comments
(HERMAN commands).  Blank lines are also stripped, and the default RECSIZE is
79.
 
CDC | LC
          Changes primitive TEXT directives to lowercase.  Directive arguments,
parameters, and macro calls are NOT changed, just the few characters after a
'.'.
 
NWA/RN
          Don't print warning messages about unknown macros or duplicated
words.
 
.*B*
NUS/BS
          Don't attempt to change the order of char/backspace/underscore to
underscore/backspace/character.
 
MA/XCOMPRESS
          Try to compress all excess spaces out of a line except those around
the first word on an input record.
 
6E/DIT
          Changes the defaults for keying the file (from 100.000, by 10.000),
and changes the default RECSIZE from 69 to 79.
 
NS/UMMARY
          Suppresses the wordcount summary line that prints after the file is
processed.
 
 
PRUNE and CDC are mutually exclusive options.
.*B*
By default, TUNA examines the input file, and reformats records longer or
shorter than 69 characters into records 69 characters or less if it knows that
TEXT FILL MODE is on for that area of the file.  If FILL MODE is OFF, no
reformatting is attempted.  The text_file is rebuilt and rekeyed from 1.000 in
increments of 1.000.  TEXT macros and control words are assumed to begin with
the character '.'.  Expect TUNA to screw up your file if you think TEXT control
words begin with anything else.
 
The output record size can be modified by use of the RECS option.  The default
is 69 by default cuz that's what works with EDIT and 80-column CRTs.  However,
if the 6EDIT option is specified, the default becomes 79, because that works
even better.  Also, if the 6EDIT option is used, the output file is rekeyed
from 100.000 by 10.000, instead of 1.000 by 1.000.
.*B*
If SENTENCES is specified, TUNA attempts to find the ends of sentences while
FILL mode is ON, and begins each new sentence on a new record.  This can be
handy if you want to move blocks of text around with EDIT.  TUNA knows where a
sentence ends by looking for a word ending in the characters period, colon,
question mark, and exclamation point AND followed by two spaces.  Therefore, a
punctuation mark ending an input record may appear to be a sentence break.
TUNA will also look to see if these punctuation marks appear before a right
paren, brace, or bracket OR a double quote, AND that special character pair is
followed by a double space.  If so, a sentence break is also found there.
 
If MAXCOMPRESS is requested, TUNA will attempt to squeeze excess spaces out of
a line while it is reformatting. It will not strip the leading blanks off an
input record, nor will it strip the blanks following the first "word" in a
record.  If MAXCOMPRESS is not requested, interword spacing remains the same as
it was in the input record.  This feature helps make writing easier by
supporting "bulleting".  For example, if you have a construct like this:
 
.fin
.inl 10
.unl 5
o    This is a bullet.  It is not .45 caliber.
 
TUNA will leave the blanks following the bullet alone, even if MAXCOMPRESS is
specified.
.*B*
TUNA also recognizes Bull-supplied macro files and assumes the correct
 .FIN/.FIF setting for each macro at the point where the macro is encountered.
 
If TUNA encounters a macro directive for a non-Bull macro, a
 .GO directive, or a .IFI directive, a warning message will be displayed on
M$DO.  The NWARN option overrides the printing of the message.
 
Macros that cause no change in the current FILL MODE setting are:
 ..:DBG,..:SRB,..:IDX,..:LnH "^,..:LnH ";   (where n=1,2,3,4,5 or 6)
 ..::HL,..::IX,..::LS,..::PH,..::RF,..::SB,..::GR
 
Macros (or directives) that force FILL MODE off are:
 .FIF,..:MAT,..:FIG,..:HLP,..:HTP,..::FG ",..::TB "
 
Macros (or directives) that force FILL MODE on are:
 .FIN,..:FND,..:END,..:FMT,..:ARF,..:LnH   (where n=0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
 ..::CH,..::IT,..::L1,..::L2,..::L3,..::L4,..::L5,..::L6,..::L7,..::L8
 ..::L9,..::TT,..::FM,..::TB,..::FG,..::TC
 
TUNA won't attempt to wrap text found between these directives:
    .BBF/.BEF    .HBB/.HBE    .FBB/.FBE    .BBE/.BEE    .HTN/HTF
.*B*
Note that TUNA is pickier than TEXT about blocks.  On one hand, it insists that
you put the matching "ending directive" in your file.  On the other hand, it
diagnoses problems in this regard.
 
If the PRUNE or STRIP option is specified, any record starting with a "." will
not pass thru to the output file.  This option is useful if you prepared a
quick and dirty document using EDIT and TUNA, then just want to print it
somewhere.
 
If the HERMAN option is specified, a source file for HERMAN.X is created by
stripping out blank lines and TEXT commands but not TEXT comments, and aligning
the left margin according to .INL and .UNL commands, with a default RECSIZE of
79.  When combined with PRUNE, HERMAN commands are also stripped.
 
If the CDC option is specified, then TUNA converts all primitive TEXT
directives (those beginning with only a single ".") to lowercase.  As well as
looking nicer, this can help you find "similar places" in a document easier and
faster.
 
Upon normal exit, TUNA prints how many words were in formatted passages, how
many records were output, and an approximate page count based on 56 records to
the page.  The message can be suppressed using NSUM.
.*B*
Had enough?  Well, TUNA will change character/backspace/underscore sequences
into underscore/backspace/character sequences to make them easier to read on a
CRT.  This can be suppressed by using the NUSBS option.
.*B*
WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING
.*R*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
.*R*
TUNA does not go out of its way to change non-CP6 backspace/underscore
sequences into CP-6 backspace underscore sequences.  The tool NOBS.X should be
used to guarantee that your input file has the correct backspace/underscore
structure.  TUNA will, however, attempt to determine a non-CP-6 backspace
sequence and not do its rearrangement of underscores if it finds one.
.*B*
No more help is available for TUNA.  Try the TOPICS.
.*K* OPTIONS
Here are detailed descriptions of the options and their actions.
 
.*B* LENGTH WIDTH RECSIZE
LEN/GTH=line_length  or
.*R*
WID/TH=line_length   or
.*R*
RECS/SIZE=line_length
 
Sets the size of the records that TUNA produces.  The default is 69, which is
what EDIT needs.  range is 20 - 2047.   Remember that EDIT and 6EDIT are best
used at somewhat less than 255 characters per line.
.*B* SENTENCES
SENT/ENCES
 
Begin each sentence on a new line.  Sentences end in the characters :?!.
followed by two spaces, or by the characters )]}" preceeded by ?!.: and
followed by two spaces.
.*B* PRUNE STRIP
PRUNE | STRIP
 
Won't let "." records thru to the output file.  Can be handy if you like fast
formatting for preparing MAILgrams and such.
.*B* CDC LC
CDC | LC
 
Changes primitive TEXT directives to lowercase.  Directive arguments,
parameters, and macro calls are NOT changed, just the few characters after a
'.' and before the first ' '.
.*B* NWARN
NWA/RN
 
Don't print warning messages about unknown macros or duplicated words.
 
.*B* HELP HERMAN
HELP | HERMAN
 
Formats the output, honoring .INL and .UNL commands, creating a CONSEC output
file, stripped of all TEXT commands, but not TEXT comments (HERMAN commands).
Blank lines are also stripped, and the default RECSIZE is 79.
 
.*B* NUSBS
NUS/BS
 
Don't attempt to change the order of char/backspace/underscore to
underscore/backspace/character.  Why you wouldn't want to do that is beyond me,
but you can override it.  See NOBS.X for an in-depth philosophical approach to
it.
.*B* MAXCOMPRESS
MA/XCOMPRESS
 
Try to compress all excess spaces out of a line except those around the first
word on an input record.  This can be handy if you're a sloppy typist and
occasionally get two spaces where none belong.  This can be especially handy if
you TUNA once using MAXCOMPRESS,SENTENCES; then TUNA again with the default
options.
.*B* 6EDIT
6E/DIT
 
Rekeys the file from 100.00 by 10.00, for 6EDIT fans.  Also changes the default
RECSIZE from 69 to 79.
.*B* NSUMMARY
NS/UMMARY
 
Suppresses the commentary summary that prints when TUNA exits.
 
 
PRUNE and CDC are mutually exclusive options; after all, why should TUNA CDC if
you're going to PRUNE anyway?
