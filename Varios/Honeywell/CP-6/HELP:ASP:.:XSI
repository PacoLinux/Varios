ASP (Authorization of Special Privileges) is a tool to temporarily gain access
to processors and privileges to which the user does not normally have access.
You will be prompted 3 or 4 times.
 
1)  ASP will turn echoplex off and ask for your password.  Type in your logon
password.
 
2)  ASP will ask for a list of privileges.  Type in a list of privileges,
separated by commas.  Abbreviations may be used in some cases.  One processor
privilege may be specified.
 
If you specify a PPRIV, then the processor that you want to use will be
assumed.  ie.  CNTRLD will get you to CONTROL.
 
3) If you didn't specify a PPRIV, then ASP will prompt you for the processor.
Blanks are significant.  Some processors are not allowed.  As written, SUPER is
not currently allowed.
 
4) ASP will ask why you want to use ASP.  The answer must contain at least five
non-blank characters.  You should give a reasonably lucid, understandable
reason why you are doing this.  Some people enter the command they are about to
type inside the processor they are invoking.
 
ASP will then link to the specified processor.  When you exit the processor,
ASP will record the activity in a file that is checked by the Support Group on
a regular basis.
Examples:
 
 !ASP
 Password?
 What privilege[s] do you need?FMR
 What processor?PCL
 For what purpose?To look at :COMAC
 
The user will have FMREAD privilege while he is in PCL.
 
 !ASP
 Password?
 What privilege[s] do you need?ASAVE,CNTRLD
 For what purpose?To look at the partitions
 
The user will be given the ASAVE privilege, and the CNTRLD PPRIV.  And ASP will
link to CONTROL.
