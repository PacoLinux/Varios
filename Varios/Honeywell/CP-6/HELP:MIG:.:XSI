MIG (Munge Index Granules) examines a keyed, indexed, or IREL file's index
granules to estimate how much space rebuilding the file would recover.
Syntax: !MIG.X sifid [(option-list[)]]
 
sifid = File to be analyzed.
 
Option-list = a MIG option.  Currently the only implemented option is SHARE.
 
MIG will then examine the file, and produce a report of the number of deleted
indices, and the amount of space that could be recovered by a rebuild of the
file.

SHare(op)       Open the file to be examined with the specified SHARE setting.
'op' may be ALL, IN, or NONE.  Note that if the user does not have FMSEC
privilege, SHARE(ALL) and SHARE(IN) will not allow him to examine the file.
The "(op)" part may be omitted, in which case SHARE defaults to ALL.
 
DEtail          Makes MIG print a detailed listing of index-granule statistics
for each alternate index of an index or IREL file.  This option is not
implemented.
 
EXtents         Makes MIG print details of the extent list in the file's FIT.
This option is not implemented.
