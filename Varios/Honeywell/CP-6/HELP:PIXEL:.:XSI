The ANALYZE command is used to scan and analyze the pixel file.  The output of
the analysis is a set of density data, which shows the relative distribution
of pixel values within the file;  this information may be displayed via the
HISTOGRAM command, and is used to calculate a pixel-transformation vector when
the ENHANCE command is used.
 
Syntax:
 
 => AN/ALYZE [optionlist]
 
Options:
 
*  TH/RESHOLD = integer
 
   Specifies that each pixel will be reflected in the density graph
   if and only if its value differs from the value of at least one of
   its neighboring pixels by at least the specified integer.  The
   default THRESHOLD is zero, which will cause all sampled pixels to
   be included in the density graph.  Specifying a threshold of
   greater than zero will tend to remove from the graph those pixels
   which lie in uniformly-shaded areas (such as backgrounds) and to
   emphasize those pixels which lie in areas of high contrast (such
   as the edge of an object in the picture).
 
*  SA/MPLE = integer
 
   Specifies that only a specific fraction of the pixels scanned
   should be sampled and included in the analysis data.  For example,
   if SAMPLE=4 is specified, every fourth record in the pixel file
   will be processed, and every fourth byte within each such record
   will be analyzed.
 
   The default sample value is 5.
 
*  SA/MPLE [=] A/LL
   A/LL
 
   Specifies that all pixels in the file should be sampled.
 
   The "SAMPLE = ALL" and "SAMPLE = integer" options are mutually
   exclusive.

The following commands are supported by the PIXEL program:
 
 COMMAND          FUNCTION
 -------          --------
 
 ANALYZE          Perform a density analysis of a pixel file.
 HISTOGRAM        Print a histogram of the pixel density data
                  determined by the ANALYZE command, or of the
                  resulting density data requested by the user.
 PATTERN          Specify the sequences of characters which are to
                  be used to represent various ranges of pixel values.
 ENHANCE          Specify a curve of density values, to which PIXEL is
                  to attempt to fit the actual pixel data.
 PRINT            Convert a pixel file to printable form, based on
                  information provided via the PATTERN and ENHANCE
                  commands.
 WRITE            Produces an enhanced or inverted pixel file in the same
                  format as the input, with an optional header for use
                  by CAP.
 INVERT           Specify that the pixel file is (or is not) inverted
                  (0 = full dark, 255 = full light).
 END              Terminate PIXEL.
 
For information concerning any of these commands, type:
 
   HELP (PIXEL.X) commandname
 
The contrast enhancement feature in PIXEL works by analyzing the distribution
of density values within the picture, and permitting the user to shift the
densities to produce a better-looking picture when the data is printed.
 
The user initially uses the ANALYZE command, which samples the pixels in the
input file and counts the number of samples with each possible pixel value.
These totals may be displayed by the user via the HISTOGRAM command.  For
example:
 
!PIXEL.X PIXEL_USCGIRL_ID.X ON, ME
 
Pixel file PIXEL_USCGIRL_ID contains 256 records of 256 bytes each.  Output
medium will accept 80 columns per page.

This histogram contains two summaries of the pixel distribution:
 
   -  The vertical bars of '.' characters each topped with a '='
      represent the actual number of pixels sampled which had
      values in each of 64 intervals.  The scaling of this
      curve is arbitrary;  it is chosen so that the highest
      '=' displayed on the graph is 2/3 of the way to the top.
      In a picture with good contrast, these bars will tend to
      take on a bell-curve shape.
 
   -  The line of '+' characters which runs from lower left to upper
      right represents the cumulative percentage of the total
      pixels, reading from left (0, 0%) to right (255, 100%).
      In natural photographs this curve usually takes a fairly
      natural "S" shape; in most pictures with good contrast and
      detail, this curve passes fairly near the point (128, 50%).
 
At this point, the user might decide to try shifting the pixel values so that
they adhere more closely to an (arbitrary) "better" distribution.  To do this,
the ENHANCE command would be used and another HISTOGRAM generated:
 => ENHANCE (0,0),(50,10),(100,100),(128,130),(156,100),(205,10),(255,0)
 
This example requests a distribution curve which looks like this:

The user can now use the PRINT command to produce a hard copy of the image.
For details on the detail-detecting capability, type:
 
   HELP (PIXEL.X) DETAIL
 
CHANGES
Included with the PIXEL program is a sample data file full of pixels.  This
file "PIXEL_USCGIRL_ID.X" contains a digitized image of a woman's face and
shoulders shown against a fairly "vanilla" background (walls, curtains,
etc.).  This image has been widely distributed, and is a de facto standard
reference for monochrome image-processing software.
To see how the PIXEL program works, try the following:
 
Version 1 - if you are using a CRT:
 
   !PIXEL.X PIXEL_USCGIRL_ID.X
   => PATTERN ' ',':','-','=','+','%','@','#'
   => PRINT SHEETS=1, LPI=4, SMOOTH
 
Version 2 - if you are using a hard-copy printer:
 
   !PIXEL.X PIXEL_USCGIRL_ID.X
   => PATTERN 'HZ@_','H@','#','%','+','=','-',':',' '
   => PRINT SHEETS=1, LPI=4, SMOOTH
 
You may then adjust the PATTERN and LPI values to fit your particular
terminal's character set, and/or try using the ANALYZE and ENHANCE commands to
improve the visual characteristics of the picture.
When one is attempting to enhance the contrast of a picture image, it is often
desirable to concentrate on those portions of the picture which contain
substantial amounts of detail, and to ignore areas (such as background, sky,
etc.) which are largely devoid of information.  This may be done by
restricting the image-analysis process to those pixels which differ from their
"neighbors" by at least some user-specified value known as the "threshold".
 
When the user issues an ANALYZE command, an option of the form
"THRESHOLD=value" may be specified;  if THRESHOLD is not specified, a value of
0 will be assumed.  During the analysis process, each pixel which is sampled
(based on the presence or absence of the SAMPLE option) will be compared with
each of its "neighbors" (the pixels to the left and right, and above and below
it).  Only those pixels whose values differ from at least one neighbor's value
by at least the specified threshold value will be counted; thus, the density
graph produced by the HISTOGRAM command will reflect only those portions of
the image which contain an amount of detail which exceeds the THRESHOLD
value.
For example, the following three histograms demonstrate the different density
distributions of the standard "USC girl" photograph with several different
THRESHOLD values.

 => ANALYZE ALL

Note how the data gathered during the first (no-threshold) analysis has two
sharp peaks in the area of X=100.  These peaks correspond to a portion of the
picture's background which contains a large and fairly uniformly-colored
curtain.  Data from other, more interesting portions of the image is spread
out more evenly across the graph, and falls at a relatively low level.
 
In the second analysis, a threshold value of 5 is specified.  During this
analysis, any pixel which does not differ from one of its neighbors by at
least 5 points (or about 2% of the range of possible pixel values) is omitted
from the data collection.  The graph of this analysis shows the same two peaks
as the first analysis, but the height of the peaks is (relatively) lower than
in the first analysis, indicating that much of the uniformly-shaded background
has been excluded from the analysis.
 
The final analysis uses a fairly high threshold of 25, or about 10% of the
entire range of pixel values.  The trends visible in the second analysis
(lower peaks, and a wider spread of significant pixel values) are even more
visible here, as the analysis process has excluded a large percentage of the
points in the original image;  only those points which differ strongly from
those nearby are eligible for inclusion in the graph.
DETAIL_DETECTING
The ENHANCE command is used to control the contrast-enhancement feature
provided by PIXEL.  The ENHANCE command may be used to specify a "desirable"
distribution of pixel values, to suspend enhancement, and to reactivate a
previously-specified enhancement.
 
Syntax:
 
 => EN/HANCE { [ON] | OFF | point, point, .... }
 
 
   *  ON - this option may be used to re-activate a previously-
      specified enhancement curve which was deactivated via an
      "ENHANCE OFF" command.
 
   *  OFF - this option deactivates the enhancement feature.
 
   *  point, point, ... - this option activates the enhancement
      feature by specifying a density distribution curve to which
      PIXEL is to attempt to fit the pixels read from the pixel file.
      Each "point" is specified in the form "(x, y)" where X and Y
      are non-negative integers.  Each "x" value must lie in the
      range [0, 255], and must be greater than all "x" values
      specified to its left.  The "y" values are integers in an
      arbitrary range chosen by the user;  they are used to denote
      the shape of the density curve desired.
 
Examples:
 
 => ENHANCE (0,0),(50,10),(100,100),(128,130),(156,100),(205,10),(255,0)

PIXEL is designed to permit the user to analyze, manipulate, and format the
contents of a file of computer image data.  PIXEL provides the following
features:
 
   -  PIXEL can read its input from a disk file, or a labeled,
      managed, or free-form tape.  Output can be directed to a
      terminal, printer, or to a disk or tape file.
 
   -  If the pixel file is "wider" than the output file (i.e.,
      more pixels per row than columns on the output device)
      PIXEL will automatically make multiple passes over the
      data, producing several "sheets" which may be printed
      and hung together to produce extremely large pictures
      (eg. a photo of a Mars-scape, about 7 feet by 20 feet).
 
   -  PIXEL can compress pictures by skipping pixels, or expand
      them by duplicating pixels.  The compression factor can
      be specified as a rational number (2.5, 3, .5) or by
      specifying the number of sheets which are to be printed.
 
   -  PIXEL assumes that the device on which the picture will
      be printed has 10 columns to the horizontal inch and 6
      lines to the vertical inch.  The user may alter these
      assumptions with simple options.
 
   -  PIXEL permits (requires) the user to specify a set of
      character sequences which are to be used to print the
      picture.  Each sequence may consist of several characters,
      which will be printed on top of one another.
 
   -  PIXEL normally produces CP-6 unit-record output, which may
      be directed to the terminal or to a symbiont printer.
      It is also possible to write output to a consecutive disk
      file or to a tape, with vertical-formatting characters
      in any of several styles (CP-6, XDS, and ANS standard).
 
   -  The data in a pixel file can be scanned and sampled.  Density
      data is gathered, and a histogram of the density distribution
      can be produced.  The sampling process can be made to ignore
      areas of low contrast and to concentrate on areas containing
      substantial amounts of detail.
 
   -  After examining the density histogram, the user may enter a
      "suggested" density function which is known to result in a
      printed picture of higher quality.  PIXEL will calculate
      a function which will subsequently be used to map the pixels
      read from the input file onto the "suggested" density curve.

DATA_FILES
DEMONSTRATION
The HISTOGRAM command may be used to display a graph of the pixel density
distribution calculated via the ANALYZE command, or to display the density
distribution which the user has requested via the ENHANCE command.  The output
of this command is a graph, with the X axis representing the range of possible
pixel values (0 to 255) and the Y axis representing the relative number of
pixels within the file whose values correspond to the X axis values.  The
graph actually contains two sets of data for each position on the X axis:
 
*  A vertical bar of '.' characters topped by a '=', which represents
   the relative number of pixels within the file whose value matches
   X-axis position.
 
*  A single '+' character, which represents the total number of
   pixels in the file whose values are less than or equal to the
   upper limit of the X axis position.
 
Note that the scaling of the Y axis is arbitrary, and differs for each of the
two sets of data represented.
 
Syntax:
 
 => HI/STOGRAM {R/AW | D/ESIRED}
 
Options:
 
   *  R/AW - display a histogram of the actual density distribution
      calculated by the ANALYZE command.
 
   *  D/ESIRED - display a histogram of the density distribution which
      will result from the enhancement curve specified via the
      ENHANCE command.

PIXEL is a program designed to convert computer-readable image information
into a form which may be viewed by mere mortals.
 
The basis for this conversion process is the "pixel" (picture element) - a
single byte containing a value in the range [0,255], which represents the
shade of a specific (small) portion of a photographic image.  Pixels can be
produced in a number of ways:
 
*  An optical scanner may be used to examine a photographic
   negative, print, or slide.
 
*  The output of a video camera may be fed into a digitizing
   device, which converts the video signal to pixel form.
 
*  A computer program may directly synthesize an image in pixel
   form.
 
The PIXEL program operates on files which contain (in essence) a rectangular
matrix of pixels.  Each record in the file represents one horizontal strip of
the image;  each byte within a record represents one small square portion of
the horizontal strip.
 
In simplest terms, the function of the PIXEL program is to convert each pixel
in the input file to a printable character (or set of characters) in the
output file;  when these characters are output to a line printer (or similar
device), they will darken the paper in an amount which depends on the
character(s) chosen and which (in theory) corresponds to the darkness
represented by the original pixels.  The actual characters used are specified
by the user, and must be selected according to the characteristics of the
actual printer being used.
 
Within the computer and graphic-arts industries, there is a great deal of
variation in the characteristics of both pixel-creating devices (optical
scanners and video converters) and character- printing devices (character and
line printers).  The PIXEL program has been designed with features which
permit the user to adapt the program's operation in ways which will permit its
use with many different varieties of input/output devices.  The program makes
several fixed assumptions, which cannot be over-ridden:
 
*  The pixel file represents a rectangular matrix of pixels:  all
   records have the same number of pixels, representing one
   horizontal strip of the picture.
 
*  Each pixel represents a square subsegment of the picture.
 
*  The value of each pixel is a non-negative integer less than 256.
 
The PIXEL program can operate in a number of modes, depending on commands and
options specified by the user.  Among these modes are the following:
 
   [pixel file]  -----translation----->  [print image file]
 
   [pixel file]  ------analysis------->  [density histogram]
 
   [density histogram]---\
                          >--analysis->  [enhancement data]
   [desired densities]---/
 
   [pixel file]----------\
                          >----------->  [enhanced print image file]
   [enhancement data]----/

   HELP (PIXEL.X) FEATURES    or
   HELP (PIXEL.X) COMMANDS
 
For most users of PIXEL, the device-of-choice for printing pictures will
probably be a standard CP-6 line printer, or a dot-matrix terminal or printer
such as a Decwriter (trademark Digital Equipment Corporation) or Rosy
(trademark Bull HN).  These devices are designed
primarily for printing textual data, rather than graphics;  they normally
print characters at fixed horizontal and vertical positions on a page, and
cannot "fill in the gaps" between characters.  It is thus impossible to fully
"black out" any area in a picture with a single print operation;  this may
tend to limit the contrast and detail which may be displayed.
 
One method which can be used to "work around" this limitation is to print the
picture twice on the same sheet(s) of paper, altering the paper's physical
position slightly between passes.  When this is done properly, the characters
printed on the second pass will fall "between" the characters printed on the
first pass, filling in most of the blank spaces between the original
characters and significantly darkening the picture (thus improving the
contrast).
 
Hints on improving detail:
 
When a picture is run through a printer for the second time, it can be useful
to change some of PIXEL's options slightly, so as to emphasize areas of detail
which were not resolved well during the first pass.  Some things which may be
changed include:
 
1) The PATTERNs to be used.
 
2) The ENHANCEment curve.  Shifting the curve to the left or right
   5 or 10 points, or changing its shape somewhat, will often cause
   previously-unresolved detail to become visible (usually at the
   expense of detail which was resolved well during the first pass).
 
3) The SHIFT parameter.  When the COMPRESS or SHEETS options are used
   on the PRINT command, PIXEL performs the necessary compression by
   selectively skipping entire rows or columns of pixels from the
   input file, so as to shrink the image to the desired size.  For
   example, if COMPRESS=2 is specified, PIXEL will process the 0th,
   2nd, 4th, and all other even-numbered columns, and will skip the
   1st, 3rd, 5th, and other odd-numbered columns.  The SHIFT option
   may be used to change this behavior, by specifying the number of
   the first column (and row) of pixels to be used.  For example,
   if COMPRESS=3 and SHIFT=1 are specified, PIXEL will process the
   1st, 4th, 7th, ... and skip the 0th, 2nd-3rd, 5th-6th, and so
   forth.
 
   A useful rule of thumb:  when printing the second pass, specify
   a SHIFT value of 1/2 the COMPRESSion factor;  then, adjust your
   printer so that the paper is 1/2 column to the left and 1/2 row
   higher (so that the characters printed will be 1/2 column to the
   right and 1/2 row lower).

The PATTERN command is used to specify the sets of characters which are to be
used as the printed representations of pixels whose values fall into specific
ranges.
 
Syntax:
 
 => PA/TTERN string,string,.....
 
Each "string" is a sequence of 1 to 6 printable ASCII characters, enclosed in
either 'single quote' or /slash/ characters.  Up to 32 strings may be
specified.
 
When the user specifies a set of "n" strings, PIXEL will break up the range of
legal pixel values (0 to 255) into "n" intervals of approximately equal size,
and will assign one string to each such interval.  The first string specified
will correspond to the lowest-valued interval, and the last string will
correspond to the highest-valued interval.
 
When a string contains more than one character, PIXEL will print all of the
specified characters on top of one another by making use of the "overstrike"
vertical-formatting capabilities of most line printers.
 
Examples:
 
 => PATTERN ' ','-',':','+','=','!','&','$','#','@','@Z[]_'

The PRINT command is used to convert a pixel file into a line-printer image,
based on parameters set via the PATTERN and (optionally) ENHANCE commands.
Options on the PRINT command control the horizontal and vertical spacing to be
assumed for the output device, the size of the final printout, the vertical
format characters to be used, and the smoothing feature.
 
Syntax:
 
 => PR/INT [optionlist]
 
Options:
 
*  LPI = integer - specifies the number of lines-per-inch printed
   by the printer (or other device) on which this picture will
   actually be output.  LPI is set to 6 when PIXEL is first invoked.
 
*  CPI = integer - specifies the number of characters per inch
   (horizontal) printed by the output device.  CPI=10 is assumed
   when PIXEL is first invoked.
 
*  COMPRESS = integer[.integer] - specifies a compression factor,
   which will be used to decrease (or increase) the final size of
   the printout produced.  When PIXEL is first invoked, a compression
   factor of 1.0 (no compression) is assumed.  A compression factor
   of 2.0 will cut the width and length of the printout in half;
   a factor of 0.5 will double the width and length.  Note that the
   compression factor can also be set (indirectly) via the SHEETS
   option.
 
*  SMOOTH - indicates that the anti-aliasing (edge-smoothing)
   feature should be enabled for the duration of this PRINT command.
 
*  VFC = {ANS | XDS | CP6} - specifies the type of vertical-formatting
   character to be placed in the print-image records written through
   M$LO.  VFC defaults to CP6 if M$LO is assigned to a unit-record
   device or file, or to a timesharing terminal, and defaults to
   ANS if M$LO is assigned to anything else.
 
*  SHEETS = integer - specifies the number of sheets (vertical strips
   of pages) to be printed.  PIXEL will use this value (along with
   the known width of the output device) to calculate a compression
   factor (a la the COMPRESS option).
 
*  SHIFT = integer - specifies the pixel-offset value to be used
   when selecting pixels for printing.  This option is intended to be
   used when a high-quality picture is being generated via the
   "multi-pass" technique.  See !HELP (PIXEL.X) MULTIPASS for
   information.
 
Most of these options are "remembered" - that is, if the option is used on one
PRINT command, its value will be retained and used on subsequent PRINT
commands unless/until the option is used again (with a different value) on a
later PRINT command.  All of the above options are remembered, except for
SHIFT, SMOOTH, and VFC.
 
PIXEL will print the data through the M$LO DCB.  The destination for the data
may either be specified via a SET command before PIXEL is invoked, or on the
invocation line as:
 
!PIXEL.X data_file OVER ,destination
 
The width of the destination is taken from F$DCB.WIDTH# if the destination is
a device, such as a line printer, or a unit record file.  If the destination
is a normal file, then F$DCB.RECL-1 is used.  If you want the data to go to a
file, then the best way is to use the SET command, ie.
 
!SET M$LO destination,ORG=CONSEC,RECL=200
 
The maximum output record size is currently 4095 characters, plus a VFC
character.

The WRITE command can be used to produce a "pre-enhanced" and/or a
"pre-inverted" pixel file.  This can be used instead of trying to
remember enhancement parameters, and whether or not a file has to
be inverted.  Also, the CAP option can be used to produce files
for inclusion in CAP documents.  Cappix files must be pre-enhanced
and inverted, if necessary.
 
Syntax:
 
 => WR[ITE] [CAP]
 
 
   * CAP - This options tells PIXEL.X to put a "Cappix" header on the
     file for inclusion in a CAP document.
 
PIXEL will write the data through the F$ENHANCE DCB.  The destination
for the data may either be specified via a SET command before PIXEL
is invoked, or on the invocation line as:
 
!PIXEL.X data_file OVER destination
