GRUB can Get Rid of Unwanted Blocks in a text file.
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRUB.X input_file  output_file
 
where:
 
 input_file is an edit file
 output_file is the file in which to put the GRUBy output.
 
Upon invocation, GRUB will prompt for a start string. This is the string which
identifies the first line of the block(s) to be deleted.  Grub will then ask
for the stop string.  This is the string which marks the line where GRUB will
once again start copying.
 
For example, if the input file looks like this:
ABC: PROC;
END ABC;
%EOD;
-- Include information --
File FROG.:LIBRARY was referenced.
XYZ: PROC;
END XYZ;
 
And the start and stop strings were "--" and "PROC;" then the result would be:
 
ABC: PROC;
END ABC;
%EOD;
XYZ: PROC;
END XYZ;
