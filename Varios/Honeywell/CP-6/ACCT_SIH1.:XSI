ACCT - CP-6 ACCOUNTING PROGRAM
    ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE
    THE COBOL DATA STRUCTURE FOR THE CP-6 ACCOUNTING LOG
    PLUS AN EXAMPLE OF A PROGRAM THAT USES THE STRUCTURE.
.*B*
 
    THIS PROGRAM IS USED TO PRODUCE ACCOUNT
    REPORTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF JOBS (ONLINE AND
    BATCH) RUN.  THERE ARE THREE (3) PRIMARY REPORT FORMS
    (1) SUMMARY OF EACH ACCOUNT/NAME WITHIN A DEPARTMENT
        SPECIFIED BY THE COST CENTER TABLE AND A TOTAL OF
        THE DEPARTMENT USAGE.
    (2) SUMMARY LISTING OF EACH DEPARTMENT TOTAL BROKEN
        DOWN BY BATCH/TS (CPU,ELAP,AND PERCENTAGES) ALSO
        CONTAINS THE OVERALL SYSTEM USAGE FIGURES FOR THE
        SELECTED TIME PERIOD.
    (3) A DETAIL LISTING/SUMMARY OF SELECTED ACCOUNTS
        WITH * ALL * JOBS RUN IN THAT ACCOUNT FOR THE
        SPECIFIED TIME. (OPTION: A LISTING/SUMMARY OF
        * ALL * JOBS RUN IN ALL ACCOUNTS IS POSSIBLE
        BUT DUE TO THE VOLUME OF OUTPUT IT SHOULD BE
        USED ONLY ON VERY SPECIAL OCCASIONS IF THE TIME
        PERIOD IS LONGER THAN ONE 24 HOUR PERIOD.
 
    INPUT FOR THIS PROGRAM IS THE ACCOUNTING RECORD
    PRODUCED BY THE MONITOR AND KEPT IN THE :ACCTLG
    FILE IN :SYS.
 
    THE DCB "ACCTLG" MUST BE SET TO THE FILE THAT CONTAINS
    THE ACCOUNTING LOG RECORDS TO BE PROCESSED. ALL OTHER DCB
    SETTINGS WILL ASSUME SYSTEM DEFAULTS - UNLESS OTHERWISE
    SPECIFIED.
 
.*B*
    THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ARE USED BY THE ACCOUNTING
    PROGRAM TO PRODUCE ACCOUNT REPORTS:
 
    +DATE - SELECTS ACCOUNT LOG ENTRIES CREATED FROM THE
         STARTING DATE TO THE ENDING DATE AS SPECIFIED ON THE
         SUCCEEDING DATA RECORD (MM/DD/YYTOMM/DD/YY).
    +LIST - SELECTS ACCOUNT LOG ENTRIES FOR THE
         ACCOUNTS SPECIFIED IN SUCCEEDING DATA RECORDS
         (THE FIRST RECORD CONTAINS THE COUNT;  THE
         FOLLOWING RECORDS CONTAIN THE ACCOUNTS TO LIST).
    +RATE - SPECIFIES THAT THE SUCCEEDING DATA RECORD
         CONTAINS THE DOLLAR CHARGE TO BE ASSESSED FOR THE
         FOLLOWING ITEMS ( GENERATED ONLY IN CONJUCTION
         WITH THE LIST COMMAND ):
              1. MONITOR SERVICES CALLS (PMMES) ISSUED
              2. PAGES PRINTED
              3. I-O ACCESS
              4. CPU TIME
              5. ELAPSED TIME
              6. TAPES USED
         AN EXAMPLE OF THE FORMAT OF THE DATA CARD GIVEN
         THE FOLLOWING CHARGES:
              .0004 PER PMME, .01 PER PAGE, .0001 PER I-O,
              600. PER HOUR CPU, 10. PER MIN ELAPSED TIME,
              1. PER TAPE MOUNT.
         STARTING IN COLUMN 1 WOULD BE:
              00004 00100 00001 60000 01000 00100
 
    +RUN - SPECIFIES NO MORE COMMAND IMAGES.
