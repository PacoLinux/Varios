FWEDITOR builds and edits a customized firmware file from an IFAD tape.
     The editor performs the following functions:
 
 * EDIT - to specify input/output file name for editing.
 * LIST - to list firmware module name on IFAD tape or on
   disk file.
 * BUILD - build a disk file of selected firmware modules
   from IFAD tape.
 * DELETE - delete one or more firmware modules from disk file.
 * ADD - add one or more firmware modules from tape or disk
   file to another disk file.
 * REPLACE - replace one or more firmware modules of disk file
  by modules selected from tape or another disk file.
 
       To run FWEDITOR, type !FWEDITOR.X at the IBEX level.
       FWEDITOR will then prompt with a colon ('$') for a command.

     Add new capability to display different revisions of firmware
module. To do this simply specify only module_code in firmware-entry-
list without firmware_file_name.
830615
     Add new option in firmware-entry-list, revision number of
firmware modules can be specified by follow module name with a
space and 'REV.'nn.
3.1 The firmware editor is invoked by the IBEX command.
    FWEDITOR.X  [ fid1 {ON|OVER|INTO} ]  fid3
   The command used to change input and output file names
    during the session is:
 
    EDIT [ fid1 {ON|OVER|INTO} ]  fid3
 
    fid1 - input IFAD tape number or firmware file name.
    fid3 - output firmware file name.
 
3.2 LIST invocation and format
 
          [fw-entry-list]
    L/IST                  [ {ON|OVER|INTO} fid4 ]
          [{ALL|CP6}    ]
 
 parameters:
 
  fw-entry-list - specifies one or more system firmware files
  accompanied by optional firmware module codes. No diagnostic
  firmware code can be selected with this list. The format of
  fw-entry-list is:
 
  FirmWare_file_name,...,FW_file_name
or
  FW_file_name(module_code,module_code REV.nn,...,module_code)
or
  FW_file_name(module_code-module_code,...,module_code)
 
  where
  FirmWare_file_name : 12 characters in column 42-53 on $OBJECT.
  module_code : 4 characters in column 74-77 on both $OBJECT and
               $DKEND cards.
  ' - ' : specifies a range of sequential firmware modules in
          the same firmware file.
  ' , ' : separates firmware files or elements of modules
          in the same firmware file.
  REV. : module_code follow by space then REV.nn will select the
         module with specified revision nn only. Otherwise, select
         the first module shown on tape for multi-revision module.
  nn : 2 characters in column 70-71 on $DKEND card at the end of
       firmware module.
 
 ALL - all firmware modules on output fid3 are selected for listing.
 CP6 - select all CP-6 applicable firmware modules on fid3. Default to
       this value if no parameter specified.
 fid4 - Optional file name to save listing output.
 
3.3 BUILD invocation and format
 
           [fw-entry-list                  ]
    B/UILD
           [{ALL|CP6} [SKIP fw-entry-list] ]
 
 parameters:
 
  SKIP - specifies modules of IFAD tape not to be included in
         firmware file. List of files and modules is the same
         as fw-entry-list.
 
  All other parameters are the same as defined previously. Selected
 modules from fid1 are put in fid3.
 
3.4 DELETE invocation and format
 
    D/ELETE fw-entry-list
 
 parameters:
 
       Parameters are the same as defined before. Only modules
  of fid3 in EDITOR command line can be deleted.
 
3.5 ADD invocation and format
 
    A/DD fw-entry-list
 
 parameters are the same as defined previously. firmware files
 and modules selected from fid1 are appended to fid3.
 
3.6 REPLACE invocation and format
 
    R/EPLACE fw-entry-list
 
 Specifies modules of fid3 are replaced by modules of the same
 name from fid1. Parameters are the same as defined previously.
