FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
CHIMP is a tool to add IMP definitions to a profile in :PRO.:SYS.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!CHIMP.X imp_ou [INTO profile_file ] (profilename)
 
where:
 
imp_ou is an object unit made by the IMP processor
 
profile_name is an existing profile
 
.*B*
CHIMP takes the records from an IMP object unit file and attaches them to a
profile in :PRO.:SYS (or the profile_file specified on the command line).
These IMPs will be applied to the terminal whenever the profile is invoked.
This allows TP terminals and operator consoles to have IMPs by specifing a
profile with IMPs attached to it.  The user must have access to :PRO.:SYS to be
able to run CHIMP.  CHIMP IMPs can be removed from a profile by using NO or an
empty file instead of imp-ou.
