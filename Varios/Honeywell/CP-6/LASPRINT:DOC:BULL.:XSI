LASPRINT SYSTEM GUIDE
 
LASPRINT was originally written early in 1986 at Zenith Electronics Corporation
as an aid to directing common- or garden-variety line-printer output
to our first Dataproducts 2665 laser printer.
Our previous laser printer had no page-formatting program installed; if one
sent it a text file, one would always get a printed sheet back -- PostScript
came as quite a shock.
 
The original function of this program was simply to send line-oriented computer output to the
printer, while allowing for selection of character shapes and sizes,
line spacing, and margins.
LASPRINT has grown over the years ('creeping featurism' is not a concept
unique to UNIX).
Although there have been constant requests to add elements normally associated with
display graphics, I have added relatively few such features -- this is still primarily
a bulk computer-output printing utility.
 
The program is moderately specific to the Dataproducts printers.
Definition of the paper supply bin is possibly unique to Dataproducts;
definition of a number of copies is common to (at least) the
Apple printer -- these are the only known printer-specific commands used.
The program is greatly specific to the CP-6 operating system, and to one
narrowly-defined set of form names.
 
This was the first program I wrote that produced PostScript output, and it does not
produce particularly efficient PostScript code.
Specifically, the Adobe-recommended approach of having a block of local command
definitions at the beginning of each PostScript program would substantially
reduce the amount of data transferred to the printer (by up to 15%); but
we can still send data to the printers faster than they will rasterize and
print, so I have had no particular motivation to modify this particular condition.
 
LASPRINT was written solely as an internal utility, and is known to have
some undocumented elements (both bugs and features).
Since I address these elements only on a time-available basis, and since other users
may want to use the program differently than I intend, you
may find some things not to your liking.
Please feel free to debugize, customize, modifize, bastardize, or otherwise improve the source
provided here.
If you do add some useful stuff to the program, please send me a copy of
your changes so that I can include them in our version, as well.
 
This submission includes:
 
.INL 6
.UNL 6
LASPRINT:SU - The CP-6 Fortran source code, to send to two printers, and supporting
both 1260 and 2665 Dataproducts printers.
If a different number of printers is to be supported, 'LZ02' must be deleted or 'LZ0n' must
be added as valid options.
If the 1260 printer is not supported, the number of fonts (NFONTS) must be changed
and the surplus font data deleted or commented out.
If the 2665 printer is not supported or, the 'PAPER option code must be deleted or commented out,
along with the PAPTX and NPAPS definitions.
 
.UNL 6
UCASE:SU - A PL-6 routine which will convert a given string to all upper-case characters.
 
.UNL 6
SEARCH$:SU - A PL-6 routine which impleents the SEARCH instruction.
 
.UNL 6
LASPRINT - A CP-6 run unit obtained by compiling and linking the :SU files
supplied with this submission.
This run unit is intended to reside in .:SYS -- if it does not, changes will be
required to the "Lasprint Command Line" section of the User Guide.
 
.UNL 6
LASPRINT:CL - The compile-and-link JCL used to create the run unit.
 
.UNL 6
LASPRINT:TX - A CP-6 TEXT file which will create the User Guide for the case where two printers
(1260 and 2665) are supported, when run through LASPRINT using this command entry:
 
.INL 10
.FIF
LASPRINT LASPRINT:TX TO LZ01(VMT=.3,VMB=.3,HML=.75,CPI=10.6)
 
.INL 6
.FIN
This file expects to be printed on a Dataproducts 1260 printer or equivalent
(one which supports the following Adobe font families:
 
.INL 10
.FIF
Symbol             Courier             Times
Helvetica          Helvetica Narrow    Avant Garde
Bookman            Palatino            Zapf Dingbats
Zapf Chancery      New Century Schoolbook
 
.INL 6
.FIN
Please change the "INSERT YOUR NAME HERE" line on the last page of the
index to reflect your local support person's name and phone number.
 
Note that this file will take quite a long time to rasterize and print.
Expect at least half an hour on a Dataproducts 1260.
 
.UNL 5
LASPRINT:TX:B - Identical with LASPRINT:TX except for the case where only one printer (a 2665)
is supported.
 
.UNL 5
LASPRINT:TX:C - Identical with LASPRINT:TX except for the case where only one printer (a 1260)
is supported.
 
.UNL 6
LASP:OPTS - A sample options file, as discussed on Page 1-3 of the User Guide.
 
.UNL 6
LASPRINT:NEWS - A sample News file that is intended to reside in the .X account.
If it will be elsewhere, a modification to the OPEN statement in the :SU file
will be required.
 
.UNL 6
LASPRINT:DOC - This document.
 
.UNL 6
cshow - A PostScript routine which must be added to the systemdict of the printer,
which operates as 'show' but center-justifies the text fragment.
 
.UNL 6
rshow - A PostScript routine which must be added to the systemdict of the printer,
which operates as 'show' but right-justifies the text fragment.
 
.UNL 6
ushow - A PostScript routine which must be added to the systemdict of the printer,
which operates as 'show' but underlines the text fragment.
 
.UNL 6
cushow - A PostScript routine which must be added to the systemdict of the printer,
which operates as 'show' but underlines and center-justifies the text fragment.
 
.UNL 6
rushow - A PostScript routine which must be added to the systemdict of the printer,
which operates as 'show' but underlines and right-justifies the text fragment.
 
.UNL 6
banner2 - A PostScript routine which must be added to the systemdict of the printer,
which creates the banner sheet (as seen in Pages 4-6 and 4-7 of the User Guide).
Please modify the graphics to suit your site.

and I will attempt to help on a time-available basis.
I regret that I cannot promise to make program modifications,
whether for new features or for bug fixes, but I will try to
assist with background information and advice whenever I can.
 
LASPRINT was written entirely as a utility for use by Zenith.
It has been used extensively and has been modified several times, but it is
not in the bug-free condition that would be expected of commercial software.
No warranty is made as to program performance or documentation accuracy.
The run unit supplied on the tape was obtained by executing the :CL file
that is supplied against the :SU file that is supplied; there are NO
additions or patches to the run unit that perform any other action than
those which exist in the :SU file.
 
There are some external entities which will be required:
 
.INL 5
.UNL 5
PostScript entities.  These must appear in the systemdict in the printer:
 
.FIF
.UNL 5
rshow     cshow     ushow     rshow     cshow
 
.FIN
These will underline, and right and left justify text, operating
in a manner similar to show.
 
.UNL 5
banner2
 
This will create the banner shown on pages 4-6 and 4-7 of the User Guide.
The legend must be changed for your site.
 
.UNL 5
CP-6 forms.  These must be defined and accessible to LASPRINT.
 
These will convert to upper-case, and implement the SEARCH command.
Both are PL-6 routines, for which source is included.
 
.UNL 5
FOXI
 
This is a set of high-speed I/O routines, which are in the E00 'X' account.
