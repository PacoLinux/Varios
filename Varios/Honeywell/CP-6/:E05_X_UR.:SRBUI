       _______       PURPOSE
 
 
       This Software Release Bulletin documents release E05 of the CP-6 Utility
       Programs.  This product operates on Control Program-Six (CP-6) software,
       release E05.
 
       The CP-6 Utility Programs are a set of software tools, commonly referred
       to as the X account, most of which were created to assist the software
       development process at LADC.  They are made available to the CP-6
       community of users as potential aids to their own software development
       work.  The account contents are defined by LADC and may change from
       release to release at the discretion of the development center.  Each
       release will introduce new and modified tools, as well as remove
       obsolete or outdated tools.
 
       It is important to note that the X account tools comprise a set of
       significant supplements to the basic CP-6 capabilities.  Many of these
       tools, in fact, are almost as mandatory to have on your machine as the
       items in .:SYS, if for no other reason than that Perigon developers
       logging onto your machine for maintenance purposes need these tools to
       help them more effectively support your machine.
 
       Therefore, as noted in the HOST SRB, the installation of the X account
       is a mandatory step in the installation of your CP-6 system.

            ---------       -----------------
 
            .:XSI           An entire account containing the E05 X account.
            :E05_X          X Account SRB in .:SRB
 
       The account .:XSI contains the source code and JCL to create run units
       for each of the unsupported Utility Programs normally found in the
       X account.  Each of the JCL files in this account is identified by the
       suffix _CRU (Create Run Unit).  HELP files for each of the utilities in
       this account provide the documentation for the tools and may be accessed
       via the system HELP facility (HELP (A.X) or HELP (A.:XSI)).  Once the
       E05 .:XSI account has been restored from the tools tapes, the E05
       X account can be created by issuing the following command:
 
 
           !XEQ $BUILD_X_ACCT.:XSI
 
       from an account that has write permission (!PRIV FMS) to the X account;
       see the installation instructions below for full instructions.  Note
       that in the E02 and later releases, you may also
 
           !BATCH $BUILD_X_ACCT.:XSI
 
       You may need to make a partition big enough to handle a job that needs
       120 minutes of CPU time and 255K of memory.

       __________________________       Why install the X Account?
 
 
       Why do we distribute the X account as .:XSI, then make you copy it to an
       account named .X?  Since the account .:XSI contains the largest single
       body of gratis CP-6 programming examples that we can think of, we feel
       that it is important that you have this set of software available to
       your site's programmers.  Since the things in the X account are simply
       copies of things in .:XSI, we felt that we could save the hassle of our
       writing and your restoring an extra tape during X account installation
       by making a job that creates the X account for you.  We do realize that
       the .:XSI account is sizable, and you may choose not to retain it after
       installing .X.  However, the packaging technique makes this YOUR CHOICE,
       and, hopefully, you will choose what is best for your system.
 
       Another influencing factor on this packaging decision is our observation
       that most of our users install the X account ONLY ONCE during the life
       cycle of the existence of a particular software release on their system.
       If you are in the position of constantly de-installing and re-installing
       CP-6, we recommend that you install the X account ONLY ONCE, make an EFT
       backup of the X account, then use that EFT tape to restore the X account
       whenever you need to re-install.
 
 
       IMPORTANT CUSTOMER NOTICE
       -------------------------
 
       Note that the fact that a tool or its _CRU file exists is no guarantee
       that a customer will be able to run or recreate a tool onsite; the
       development center reserves the right to use proprietary include files,
       OU's, data files, shared libraries, and other elements to create the
       tools, and operates without the requirement to release these proprietary
       items to customers who have not purchased the relevant product or CP-6
       system source.
 
       You may notice source in .:XSI for tools that do not end up being
       installed in .X by the $BUILD_X_ACCT job.  These sources are for tools
       submitted, but not integrated prior to E05 release.  The source remains
       in .:XSI for the same reasons X account source exists in .:XSI -- to
       provide sites with programming examples.

       ________________________       SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION
 
 
       By and large, the user documentation for the tools is contained in the
       HELP files.  The file NEW_SIT1.:XSI contains the document used for
       maintaining the X account at the development center and may prove
       enlightening.  Of course, there's this document, too.  For help on X
       account tools, type the following:
 
           !HELP (XINDEX.X)
 
       For the E05 release, these tools were considered "updated" since the E04
       release:
 
       For the E05 release, these tools were considered "updated" over the E04
       release:

       These tools were made year 2000 ready:
 
       BISON       CALEN       DATE       GIMME       JEDI       RATFOR
       THING       TIDY        VOUCHER
 
       For the E05 release, these tools have been deleted:
 
       BANTER      ERNE        FEPCON    MOLE         PERCH      SHREW
 
       The tools for this release have HELP files that contain CHANGES topics
       (if the tools have been modified).  The CHANGES topic can be used to
       determine if a tool has been modified and to what extent.
 
       To get additional information, try the help file for each item after the
       various tools have been installed, e.g.,
 
           !HELP (RUDD.X)
 
       Additional change and X account information can be obtained by
       installing the X account and typing:
 
           !NEW.X
 
       on a CP-6 timesharing terminal.  More information may be obtained by
       typing
 
           !?
 
       after the initial message.

                                                    KNOWN ERRORS AND SHORTFALLS
 
 
 
 
 
 
       FILER.X has not been updated for this release.  The version of FILER.X
       that is being released has no support for M$ATTACH.  See STAR 42967 for
       more details.
 
       There are no other known errors or shortfalls, other than those
       described in STARLOG.
 
       Problems with (or suggestions regarding) the X account utilities should
       be reported with STARLOG using subject name X, version E05, at severity
       D only.  X account tools are NOT maintained via the patching techniques
       used for the "higher priced" software, like that found in .:SYS.  Due to
       this release-to-release support system, and the fact that changes to the
       X account (even corrections) are largely due to the voluntary
       intervention of a charitable ("time permitting") Perigon programmer, the
       X account has had low-priority support.  Additionally, the techniques
       used at Perigon to maintain the X account preclude source updates and
       reflection in standard STARLOG priority/resolution statistics.

                                                    INSTALLING UTILITY PROGRAMS
 
 
 
 
 
       This section outlines the steps necessary to proceed from receipt of the
       release contents to having the updated set of CP-6 utility software
       installed.  The reader should also study the relevant sections of the
       Operations Reference Manual and the System Support Manual.
 
       Utility Programs are installed separately from the remainder of the CP-6
       system.  If you received the Utility Programs as part of the CP-6 Host
       Kernal you should follow the Host Kernal SRB's installation
       instructions.  If you received the Utility Programs apart from the Host
       Kernal, please follow the installation instructions below:
 
 
 
       _________________________       INSTALLING THE TOOLS TAPE
 
 
       1.  Log on to any terminal to a suitably privileged account; required is
           FMSEC privilege or WRITE access to .:XSI and .X.  If you've already
           installed your system, these accounts will already be there.
 
           MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST 27000 GRANULES AVAILABLE IN .:XSI AND ON
           THE PACKSET THAT CONTAINS .:XSI.
 
           MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST 12000 GRANULES AVAILABLE IN .X AND ON
           THE PACKSET THAT CONTAINS .X.
 
       2.  Install the X account update tape.
 
           a.  Restore the tools tape using PCL
 
               !ORES MT(1600)=1
               !EFT
               *RESTORE LT#CP6T00 OVER DP#xx.:XSI (where 'xx' is the packset
               *REMOVE LT#CP6T00                   of your choice)
               *END
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_X                   Installing the Tools Tape                    4-1
           
 
 
       3.  Move the E05 updates to your X account.
 
               !PRIV FMS   " only needed if no write access to accounts"
               !XEQ $BUILD_X_ACCT.:XSI
                     or
               !BATCH $BUILD_X_ACCT.:XSI
 
           If you !BATCH the create job, be sure to do it from an account that
           has FMSEC privilege or the appropriate WRITE permissions.  Also,
           make sure that you have a batch partition large enough to handle a
           job that asks for 120 minutes of CPU time and 255K of memory.
 
           For Example:
 
               !CONTROL
               SET PMAXTI(1)=120
               SET PMAXMM(1)=255
               SET PJMAX(1)=1
               STORE
               END
 
           On a console:
 
               !ON BA 1
 
           Users with limited file space can now remove all files in the .:XSI
           account.
 
               !DEL ?.:XSI
               YES$
 
       The E05 X account may now be considered "installed".
