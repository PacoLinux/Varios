FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
XPRINT (X-ternal PRINTing tool) copies files to output devices on other
machines.  At LADC, it copies stuff to the A (if you're on the B) and the B (if
you're on the A).
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!XPRINT.X file [ON dd[@wsn]]
 
where file is a disk file and dd@wsn is the device name and workstation where
the file is to print after it reaches the other machine.
 
XPRINT copies the specified input file to the specified output device on the
other machine.  If the input file is a UR (unit-record) file, the file will be
copied to the output device with VFC and its formname from the source file.
 
XPRINT requires that you place logon information (for the job to be runr on the
other machine) into a command variable called XPRINT_X_PASS prior to invoking
him....e.g.:
 
!LET XPRINT_X_PASS='MYSECRET'      "will assume current account,uname
     or
.*R*
!LET XPRINT_X_PASS='FRED,FLINTSTONE,WILMA'  "will assume this string only
 
 
If the dd@wsn is not specified on the command line, the file is automatically
copied to LP@ (e.g. LP@woo) on the L66A.
.*B*
If you want to do anything fancy, you'll have to make multiple steps on your
source machine.  Like:
 
!C somefile OVER *XPRINT(K)
.*R*
!XPRINT.X *XPRINT TO LP@DVPSIG3
 
or
 
!EDGEMARK.X somefile OVER *TEMP (LE='XXX')
.*R*
!XPRINT.X *TEMP TO LP@DVPSIG3
 
or
 
!TEXT somefile OVER *TEXTO
.*R*
!XPRINT.X *TEXTO OVER LZ@UPSTAIRS
.*K* INSTALLATION
XPRINT depends on an existing HASP link between two machines (like the kind
that MAIL and MOVE and SCOTTY use).  It also depends on a special, NOXLATE
pseudo form being available on that link.  The JCL for creating that pseudo
form is duplicated here:
 
 !SUPER
 CR PSEUDO STDNX FOR STDJE "STDJE is existing form for JE device"
 END
 END
 END
 !" create the special pseudo form needed by XPRINT.X
 !COPY :FORM.:SYS(SH,'STDNX ') OVER *FORM
 !FILER.X   "clobber existing attr bits and set NOXLATE on"
    MOPEN ASN=FILE, FUN=UPDATE, ACS=DIRECT, NAME="*FORM"
    AAC400
    AKC7
    MREAD BUF=A, KEYR=YES, KEY=K
    SAW5,1   = 64
    MWRITE BUF=A, KEY=K
    MCLOSE
    X
 !COPY *FORM INTO :FORM.:SYS(SH)
 ...more
.*B*
In its current form, this tool only works well at LADC.  However, with some
interesting modifications, it could be made to work suitably at other
multiple-machine sites.
.*K* LIMITATIONS
Currently, the tool only works for records up to 140 bytes.  It only handles
LADC traffic, too.
.*K* ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
This tool would not have been possible without Gordon Guenthner, who
immediately recognized its value and provided constant enthusiatic
encouragement and detailed technical insight throughout its development.
