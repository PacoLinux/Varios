ROUTE places LADC's variable BANNERTEXT7 field on batch job banners, and allows
batch jobs to print using other than the default form for the workstation.
Full command line syntax:
 
!ROUTE text_string [(option[)]]
 
where:
 
text_string
          is the text to be assigned to BANNERTEXT7. It must be less than 80
characters, and must not contain a left parenthesis character.  If text_string
is *RESET*, the default BANNERTEXT7 from :USERS will be set to
 ' ' (a single space) prior to banner generation.
 
option is:
 
FORM=[']form_name[']
          specifies that the batch job is to be printed using the specified
form
 
ROUTE can only be run from :SYS.
For example:
 
  !ROUTE Room 243, J. Joseph
 
would make BANNERTEXT7 be 'Route 243, J. Joseph', and would rewrite the
existing output of the batch job on the default form, using the new
BANNERTEXT7.
 
  !ROUTE Lab 445 (FORM=LONG)
 
would make BANNERTEXT7 be 'Lab 445' and would rewrite the existing output of
the batch job using form LONG and the new BANNERTEXT7 definition.
ROUTE re-recreates a batch job's existing output using the specified
text_string as BANNERTEXT7 and, if specified, on the specified form.
 
ROUTE has some very special operating requirements:
 
o  It must be run from :SYS, as it requires the use of FMR privilege to get at
the existing portion of the symbiont output.
 
o  It must be run in BATCH only, as it keys off the IBEX-generated line
containing the time, date and sysid.
 
o  It must be run early in the job.  Placement of a ROUTE call right after the
!RES line in batch JCL is recommended.
At LADC, the BANNERTEXT7 field was assigned as the user-alterable field on
banner pages.  Therefore, ROUTE assigns its text to BANNERTEXT7.  If a site
requires another field to be user-alterable, this program can be easily
modified accordingly.
 
More complicated arrangements are possible, but I wrote ROUTE to meet LADC's
needs.  Other sites may have other needs that require rewriting or changing the
parsing scheme, or even establishing a default for BANNERTEXT7 using a file
other than :USERS.  Use your imagination.
