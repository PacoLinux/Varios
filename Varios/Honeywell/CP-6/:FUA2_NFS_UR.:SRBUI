       filesystem, or part of it, as if it were resident on their machine.
 
       The Network File System consists of three processors:
 
       o   NFSD, which is the Network File System server processor;
 
       o   NFSA, which is a processor that allows you to create an
           authorization file suitable for use by the NFSD system ghost; and
 
       o   NFSU, which is a processor that allows you to set NFS parameters,
           display NFS execution information, and build the NFS system
           authorization file.

       ____________________________       Compatibility Considerations
 
 
       CP-6 NFS A02 must run in conjunction with these other products:
 
       o   CP-6 Host/FEP version E04 or E05 (tested on E05).
           Note: only version E05 is year 2000 ready.
 
       o   CP-6 TCP software version A01 or A02 (tested on A02).
           Note: only version A02 is year 2000 ready.
 
       CP-6 NFS A02 requires that the CMC board in the CP-6 TCP/IP FEP be
       configured to use the largest possible datagram size.  The procedure for
       doing this is described in the "man" page for the /etc/netbin/bfrcfg
       program supplied with the CMC board.  Configure to the largest value
       (9216) and then reboot your UNIX FEP.
 
       CP-6 NFS A02 is known to operate with the following CMC board settings.

                                                  KNOWN ERRORS AND RESTRICTIONS
 
 
 
 
 
       There are no known errors or shortfalls in this release, other than
       those described in STARLOG.
 
       The following STARs apply to this release:
 
       42720 CLPA 2 10/07 A00  NFS  NFS File Cache, File Len Pblm
       42721 CLPE 3 10/11 A00  NFS  Rewrite Descrepancies

       42962 CLPE 2 11/17 A00  NFS  Test driver for read request refers to obs. field
 
 
 
       ___________       Limitations
 
 
       o   CP-6 NFS A02 operates in server mode only.  There is no client mode.
 
       o   CP-6 NFS version A02 will connect only to a single XPS or DPX FEP
           (the default UNIX FEP defined in etc:routes) connected to the CP-6
           host.  The presence of a second XPS or DPX FEP will confuse NFS
           unless etc:routes is suitably configured.  The CP-6 TCP/IP Reference
           Manual (HA26) describes how to configure the etc:routes file.
 
       o   The nfsd daemon on a DPX FEP must be disabled, so that the DPX FEP
           can be used as a CP-6 NFS front-end.
 
       o   CP-6 NFS version A02 can create only two types of files: "text"
           files and "binary" files.  The criteria to establish which file type
           to use is set on the first write to that file; if the first write
           buffer (to a maximum of 256 characters) contains only printable
           ASCII, CR, LF, HT, VT, FF, and BS, and the write position is at the
           beginning of the file, then the file is assumed to be text;
           otherwise, it is assumed to be binary.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_NFS                        Limitations                           4-1
           
 
 
 
 
 
       o   CP-6 NFS version A02 will not write into the middle of a "text"
           file; instead, upon a write, it will truncate the file at the point
           of the write.  The only file formats supported as "text" files for
           writing are consec and UR files.
 
       o   CP-6 NFS version A02 will create and update binary mode files only
           in the format already defined by the CP-6 C library.
 
       o   UNIX file names containing the character "." (period) will appear on
           CP-6 containing the substituted character "$" (dollar sign).  Any
           file already in a CP-6 directory containing the character "$" will
           appear to the NFS user as if it contained a ".".
 
       o   Packsets cannot be listed when the entire system is mounted.  Thus
           any commands using "gwd" (An internal UNIX call to Get the Working
           Directory) inside of an NFS "entire system" mounted directory may
           not work (e.g., "emacs" and "pwd").
 
       o   CP-6 NFS version A02 may incorrectly return the file length when
           first looking at a non-NFS file.  The length is correctly determined
           when the file is completely read, and then further attempts to read
           the length result in the correct value.
 
       o   The CP-6 NFS RENAME function (ex. unix 'mv' command) cannot move
           files from one CP-6 mounted directory to a different CP-6 mounted
           directory.
 
       o   While CP-6 NFS currently does interpret "." and ".." entries in
           paths, it does not report these entries via the "ls" command.
 
       o   CP-6 NFS will not allow you to remove files unless you have write
           permission to them or are the owner.

                                                       OPERATION OF THE PRODUCT
 
 
 
 
 
       The NFSD processor is the Network File System server processor.  The
       server allows users on another machine with client NFS (typically UNIX
       or a PC) to access the CP-6 filesystem, or part of it, as if it were
       resident on their machine.
 
       Before you start, make sure that you have the E04 version (or later) of
       the CP-6 Host software and the A01 (or higher) version of the TCP/IP FEP
       software installed and running. Note: only E05 version of the HOST and
       A02 version of TCP/IP are year 2000 ready.
 
 
 
       ______________________________       Invoking the NFSD System Ghost
 
 
       NFSD is most conveniently run as a ghost, from an account with access to
       at least two CL resources.  If NFSD is not being run from :SYS, the
       running account must also provide JIT privilege.
 
       To start NFSD, place the run unit in :SYS and start it using GOOSE, as
       shown in the example below.
 
       !GOOSE
       START account,uname,password USING !NFSD
       END
 
       If you want NFSD running all the time, you should put an entry into the
       GOOSE_EGG file, as shown in the example below.

       START account,uname,password AT STARTUP+3 USING !NFSD
       END
       END
 
       If desired, NFSD can be run through a non-default UNIX FEP by setting
       the F$ROUTES DCB to the appropriate FEP routing table (defaults to
       etc:routes.:SYS) before NFSD is started.  However, only one UNIX FEP can
       be run through NFSD; this means that only one copy of NFSD can be
       running at any one time.  The CP-6 TCP/IP A02 SRB describes how to setup
       FEP routing tables.
 
 
 
       ______________________________       Implementing Security Measures
 
 
       CP-6 NFS security relies mainly on the mapping of UNIX users to CP-6
       users and the defined file access permissions for those CP-6 users.  NFS
       users are limited to what they can access only by what is mounted, and
       what their mapped CP-6 names and additional privileges can access.  This
       makes the UNIX-to-CP6 user mapping file a very critical part of NFS
       security.
 
       The other security issue is the accessibility of certain accounts and
       packsets.  With CP-6 NFS, there is no way to exclude certain packsets or
       accounts from being accessed through NFS except for the built-in CP-6
       security.  The access to the file system is controlled only via the
       mounting level allowed for each UNIX host, and what the UNIX host
       mounts.
 
       Exclusion of a packset from NFS access can be accomplished if the system
       administrator controls NFS from both the CP-6 side and UNIX sides.
       Instead of mounting the entire system, the administrator could mount
       only those packsets, for which access is allowed, individually in their
       own UNIX directories.
 
       Future versions of CP-6 NFS may implement "exporting"; this would allow
       access control of the CP-6 file system at the packset and account level.
       The system administrator could easily "lock" or "open" accounts and
       packsets that CP-6 NFS can access from the CP-6 side only.

       __________________________       Operation of NFS Functions
 
 
       This section describes the differences in the supported NFS file
       manipulation functions and the corresponding CP-6 file management
       operations.  Also described are the UNIX file attributes that must be
       set for each of the file-manipulation functions to operate.  This
       section documents side-effects which are not documented in the
       specifications for NFS, and do not map directly to the corresponding
       CP-6 file management functions.
 
       Contained in a UNIX file is the creator of the file (UID and GID of the
       user - see "Implementing User Authorization With NFSA" section for more
       information on UID and GID) and file permission access bits for the
       owner (user UID matches creation UID of the file), group (user GID
       matches creation GID of the file), and other (everyone else).  This
       information is used to determine what any user can do with the file --
       read, write and execute.  The permissions refered to in the remainder of
       this section refer to the UNIX permissions, and in no way override the
       inherent CP-6 file management access permissions.
 
       The NFS file manipulation functions are the following:
 
       REMOVE:   equivalent to DELETE on CP-6.  The user must either own or
                 have write permission to the file.
 
       RENAME:   this only works if both the source and target files are in the
                 same directory.  If the target file exists, it is deleted
                 before the rename occurs.  The user must either own or have
                 write permission to the source file and, if the target file
                 exists, the user must have permission to remove it.
 
       CREATE:   if the file to be created already exists, then that file will
                 be used.  If create specifies that the file is to be
                 truncated, then all records in the file will be deleted,
                 otherwise, the file will be left intact.  The user must have
                 write permission to the file.  If a file is created without
                 write permission, no writes are allowed to it, even though
                 UNIX allows initial writes.
 
       SETATTR:  works only for NFS-created files, and works as expected.  The
                 user must own the file.
 
       READ:     works as expected with the appropriate CP-6 record to UNIX
                 record translation.  The user must have read permission to the
                 file.

       WRITE:    works as expected with the approprate UNIX record to CP-6
                 record translation.  The user must have write permission to
                 the file.
 
 
 
 
       ______________________________________       Mounting CP-6 File Systems Through NFS
 
 
       To mount a CP-6 file system via your UNIX FEP, type the following on
       your client NFS machine:
 
         /etc/mount unix-fep-name:CP6-file-system /unix-account
 
       where:
         "unix-fep-name" is the name of your UNIX front-end.
         "unix-account" is the UNIX account where the file system is mounted.
         "CP6-file-system" is the name of the CP-6 file system to mount.
           This is the portion of the CP-6 file system which is to be
           accessable from NFS, and the depth of the hierarchy therein.
           You can specify:
             "."           - MAD      (all accounts in the MAD)
             "DP#psn"      - PAD      (all accounts in the given packset)
             "DP#psn.acct" - PAD.ACCT (a fully specified account)
             ".acct"       - MAD-ACCT (an account in the MAD)
             "/"           - ALL      (all packsets on your CP-6 system)
 
       For example, if you have a UNIX front-end called "dolly", and you want
       to mount the MAD on a directory called /nfs-mnt, type the following:
 
         /etc/mount dolly:. /nfs-mnt
 
       The only UNIX users allowed to perform mounts are those listed in the
       etc:user_equiv file with the NFSOPS option MOUNT.  For these users, the
       following are the implications of the TOPLVL option:
 
         NONE - can't mount anything
         MAD -  can mount the MAD, PAD, or PAD.ACCT or MAD-ACCT
         PAD -  can mount PAD, or PAD.ACCT
         ALL -  can mount everything, the MAD, PAD, or PAD.ACCT or MAD-ACCT
 
       To unmount a directory, type the following:
 
         /etc/umount /unix-account

       _________________________________________       Implementing User Authorization With NFSA
 
 
       The processor NFSA creates an authorization file suitable for use by the
       NFSD system ghost.  NFSA also can be invoked via the BUILD command in
       NFSU.
 
 
 
       USAGE
 
 
       Typically, NFSA would be  invoked as follows:
 
         !NFSA etc:user_equiv.:SYS OVER :nfssec.:SYS
 
       The input text file (typically etc:user_equiv.:SYS) contains a list of
       UNIX users with their corresponding CP-6 user, NFS mount access and NFS
       privileges.  The security file (typically :nfssec.:SYS) is a file
       suitable for use by the NFSD system ghost.  NFSD can be directed to use
       a different security file by setting the F$NFSSEC DCB before invoking
       NFSD.
 
 
 
       FORMAT
 
 
       The format of a UNIX user entry is as follows:
 
       UNIX[ID]=( uidops ), HOST=hostop , CP6[ID]=( cp6idops ), NFS=( nfsops )
 
         uidops (UNIX users to be recognized by CP-6 NFS) :
 
           NA[ME] [ = ] unixid
 
                     User's name (first field in etc/passwd).  This is not
                     used by CP-6 NFS, but it used by LPD.X

                     User's group identifier (fourth field in etc/passwd).
                     "n" ranges from -2 To 65533  and "?" means that any
                     positive GID is accepted.  This restriction on the "?" is
                     enforced to increase security because UNIX assigns negative
                     GIDs to unsafe users. In particular GID -2 (65534 on
                     machines that use 16bit GIDs) is normally assigned to
                     'nogroup' for anonymous or untrusted logins.
 
           UID [ = ] { n | ? }
 
                     User's user identifier (third field in etc/passwd).
                     "n" ranges from -2 to 65533 and "?" means that any
                     positive UID is accepted.  This restriction on the "?" is
                     enforced to increase security because UNIX assigns negative
                     UIDs to unsafe users. In particular UID -2 (65534 on
                     machines that use 16bit UIDs) is normally assigned to
                     'nobody' for anonymous or untrusted logins.
 
         hostop (NFS clients the above users can use CP-6 NFS from) :

                     The users are allowed to use CP-6 NFS from any UNIX
                     client.
 
           ( host, host, ... )
 
                     The users are defined on, and allowed to use CP-6
                     NFS, from any of the UNIX clients listed.
 
           host
 
                     The users are defined on, and allowed to use CP-6
                     NFS, from the UNIX client listed.
 
         cp6idops (CP-6 users corresponding to UNIX users) :
 
           AC[CT] [ = ] account
 
                     CP-6 logon account with which to access the CP-6 file system.
                     This definition limits users' access as if they
                     were logged in directly to CP-6, via the builtin CP-6
                     file and account security.

                     does not do much with CP-6 NFS A02, but is intended
                     to facilitate the easy addition of "export" lists.

                     routine to work at the account level if the MAD or PAD
                     is mounted.  Default is NO if option is not specified.

                     Set FMSEC privilege.  This setting does not require the
                     CP-6 user (from cp6idops) to have FMSEC privileges.

       VERIFYING USERS
 
 
       In order for UNIX users to be able to access the CP-6 filesystem through
       CP-6 NFS, NFS must verify that they are authorized for access (via the
       NFS security information).  CP-6 NFS recognizes UNIX users as a
       HOST,GID,UID combination.  The following table lists the order in which
       CP-6 NFS looks for the presence of a user in the security information:
 
                        UID    GID    HOST
                        ------------------
                        uid    gid    host
                        uid     ?     host
                         ?     gid    host
                         ?      ?     host
                        uid    gid     ?
                        uid     ?      ?
                         ?     gid     ?
                         ?      ?      ?
 
 
 
       NOTES
 
 
       NFSA must be used every time etc:user_equiv is updated.  There is no
       automatic conversion.  Also note that NFSD needs to be restarted to
       force it to pick up the newest security information.

       ________________________________________       Configuring and Monitoring NFS with NFSU
 
 
       The NFSU program allows for the setting of NFS parameters, displaying of
       NFS execution information, and building of a system authorization file.
 
       You may be asked to run this program and report certain values if you
       request tuning support for your site.
 
       NFSU has the following commands: BUILD, DISPLAY, RESTART, SET, and
       STATS.
 
 
       B[UILD] [ F[ROM] fid1 ] [ O[VER] fid2 ]
 
           fid1 defaults to etc:user_equiv.:SYS fid2 defaults to :nfssec.:SYS
 
           This command rebuilds the security file used by NFSD by invoking
           NFSA.  NFSD should be restarted in order to get the latest security
           information.
 
       D[ISPLAY] { D[S] | F[ILES] | H[OSTS] | U[SERS] }
 
           DS (default) displays the contents of the common data segment (DS8).
           FILES dumps the FCTXs (current files CP-6 NFS is using/knows about).
           HOSTS dumps the HCTXs (current hosts which are using CP-6 NFS).
           USERS dumps the UCTXs (current users that are using CP-6 NFS).
 
       RESTART
 
           not implemented.
 
             { DS[SIZE]             }
             { DC[BS]               }
             { B[UFFERS]            } SE[T] { O[PEN] [ T[IMEOUT] ] } = n
             { Q[UICK] [ G[RANS] ]  }
             { S[LOW] [ G[RANS] ]   }
             { T[RANSIZE]           }
 
           DSSIZE
 
             The maximum number of context blocks in the common data segment
             that can be active before garbage collection is invoked.
             Acceptable values are between 20 and 2000; the default is 1950.

             The maximum number of files used, and cached, before garbage
             collection is invoked.  Acceptable values are between 20 and 120;
             the default is 120.
 
           BUFFERS
 
             The maximum number of file buffers to be used before garbage
             collection is invoked.  Acceptable values are between 20 and 255;
             the default is 255.
 
           OPEN TIMEOUT
 
             The maximum time, in seconds, which a file being "held" by CP-6
             will remain open (and busy to other CP-6 processes) since the last
             activity occured on it.  Acceptable values are 1 to 4000; the
             default is 30.
 
           QUICK GRANS
 
             The maximum size of a quick file that will be pre-read in order to
             determine its actual file length.  The default is 50.
 
             A quick file is a file which can be read in an optimized manner
             (blocked mode) in order to determine its file length, thus
             generally requiring one read per file granule.  Quick files are
             uncompressed keyed, consec, and UR files.  All other files are
             considered slow files, and require at least one read per record.
 
             When a file does not exist in the NFS cache, its file attributes
             must be determined.  One of the attributes of a file is its
             length.  The QUICK GRANS and SLOW GRANS parameters allow a
             threshold at which a file can be preread in order to determine the
             file's actual character length (which is not stored in a CP-6
             file).  If the file is not preread, the file length will most
             likely be incorrect, and will be corrected only when the file is
             processed to the end; therefore, initial attempts to use the file
             may result in incorrect behavior on the NFS client.
 
           SLOW GRANS
 
             The maximum size of a slow file that will be pre-read in order to
             determine its actual file length.  See the description under QUICK
             GRANS for more information.  The default is 10.

             The udp transfer size in bytes, generally the data size of the
             data part of READ and WRITE requests.  Acceptable values are 512
             to 8192; the default is 4096.
 
       ST[ATS]
 
           A full screen display containing the running information on NFS.
           The display is updated every 3 seconds, and requires a minimum 18x80
           window size.  <BREAK> exits from the display.

              and the CP-6 system installation instructions in the CP-6 HOST
              SRB should be followed.  The processors will be installed as part
              of the installation of the entire CP-6 system.

       The tape(s) in this package constitute a processor update release of the
       processors shown on the enclosed order form.  The tape(s) enclosed are a
       PCL labeled tape set.  It is assumed that recipients of this tape have
       already installed a running CP-6 system.
 
       For this processor update release, there are some files which must be
       DEFed onto the customer's P.O. tape set in order to allow for future
       patching, and there are some files that need to be copied into accounts
       other than .:SYS.

            normally perform your DEFs from the account .:SYSGEN.  If the
            accounts .:SRB, .:QUAC and .:DOCUM already exist, it is assumed
            that these accounts are empty (there should be no files in these
            accounts).  If you have not created these accounts, use the
            following commands:
 
                 !PIG
                 *CR DP#SYS.:SYSGEN GR=15000
                 *MADADD #SYS.:SYSGEN
                 *CR DP#SYS.:SRB GR=1000
                 *MADADD #SYS.:SRB
                 *CR DP#SYS.:DOCUM GR=6000
                 *MADADD #SYS.:DOCUM
                 *CR DP#SYS.:QUAC GR=3000
                 *MADADD #SYS.:QUAC
                 *END
 
 
       2.   Now, you should copy your existing processors into the .:SYSGEN
            account with these commands:
 
                 !PRIV ALL
                 !ORES MEM=256
                 !PCL
                 <COPYALL LT#CP6PO1#CP6PO2#CP6PO3 OVER .:SYSGEN
                 <REM LT#CP6PO3
                 <END
 
       3.   Mount the processor update release tape. This tape is a CP-6 PCL
            tape with a label that is PCL01 (possibly PCL02 also). To get the
            new processors (and their associated files) into your DEF account,
            use these commands:
 
                 !PCL
                 <COPYALL LT#PCL01[#PCL02 ...] OVER .:SYSGEN
                 <REM LT#PCL01[#PCL02 ...]
                 <END
 
       4.   Now the Software Release Bulletin (SRB) for the new product
            should be printed.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_NFS                 NFS Processor Update Tape                    6-2
            
 
 
 
 
 
            To move the necessary files from the DEF account (.:SYSGEN) into
            the .:SRB account in preparation for formatting and printing, issue
            the following command:
 
                 !XEQ $XTAPEINSTALL.:SYSGEN SRB=YES <<does this work?>>
 
            After that job has run, the :SRB account will contain the SRB for
            this release.
 
            To format the SRB for LONG form (8 1/2 by 11), issue the following
            command:
 
                 !XEQ $XTEXTALL_SRBS.:SRB
 
            The LONG, WIDE, and STDLP forms are created by XEQing $XFORM.  This
            is described in the HOST SRB, Section 5, Installing the Tools Tape.
 
       5.   The remainder of the files must be moved to the appropriate
            accounts.  Products moved into the .:SYS account will have patches
            applied automatically.  To do this, perform the following command:
 
                 !XEQ $XTAPEINSTALL.:SYSGEN SYS=YES[,DELL=YES]
 
            DELL will delete unnecessary files from :SYSGEN.  It is NOT
            recommended that you install these processors with names other than
            their primary names.
 
            If you choose to install these processors with modified RU names
            for parallel testing, you MUST also change the $XRUMORDER file in
            the :SYSGEN account accordingly.
 
            CAUTION: $XRUMORDER MUST be merged into the site's PATCH DECK
            as-is, to insure the proper operation of the AUTOMATIC patch update
            procedures.
 
       6.   A set of patches for these new products is on this processor update
            tape and will be in the file $XRUMORDER.:SYSGEN.  These patches
            should be merged into the site's patch deck (RUM section) prior to
            creating a new P.O. tape set.  You should now be ready to re-DEF a
            full P.O. tape set.  Modify the !DEFAULT lines of the
            $XDEF_FULL.SUPPORT file to provide the proper SITE_ID and SITE_NAME
            and boot density.  When the patches have merged, execute the
            following to create a new P.O. set:
 
                 !BATCH $XDEF_FULL.SUPPORT
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_NFS                 NFS Processor Update Tape                    6-3
            
 
 
 
 
 
            Note, by the time you receive and install this tape, you may be
            several weeks behind in patch releases.  Be sure to pick up all
            patches in the succeeding weekly patch files that pertain to these
            products.
 
 
       7.   When the P.O. tape set created as a result of this job is booted,
            the installation of this processor and its associated files will be
            complete.
 
       8.   Two types of tests exist in the :QUAC account, both of which
            perform some form of elementary existence checking.  Tests of the
            first type are named with the prefix ORDR and the suffix SI; these
            check to see that every element of the products you ordered is
            included in your system.  The output from these tests must be
            checked for a STEPCC of 0.  If the STEPCC for any of these tests is
            greater than 0, you are missing some component(s).  The missing
            components will be listed in the line(s) just above the line
            reporting the name of the test and the STEPCC.
 
            Tests of the second type have names of the form xx_name_GT4.  These
            tests check to see that each of the processors ordered responds
            properly when invoked; in some cases they check the performance of
            basic features.  These, too, should report a STEPCC of 0.
 
            To run the tests --
 
            After installing the new processors, log on to an account which has
            SUPERA and PIGC processor privileges, then execute the following
            job:
 
                 !SET M$LO LP
                 !XEQ $XSETUP.:QUAC
                 !R
 
            Note the first and third commands above are optional.  This job
            creates a few pages of printing and the process will be much faster
            to print the output on a printer versus a console.
 
 
            Keyin ON BA 1 at the system console to permit batch jobs.

            When the QUAC tests are finished, you will have a file called
            $RESULTS.:QUACRUN (this file is also copied to the printer at the
            end of all the tests) which consists of lines reporting the ATITLE
            and STEPCC of each test.  All of the STEPCCs should be zero.  After
            testing is complete, use SUPER to remove the testing account:
 
                !SUPER
                CMD*REM :QUACRUN,107TESTING
                CMD*END
 
           Delete all files in the :QUAC account:
 
                !DEL ?.:QUAC
                YES$

       __________________________________       Getting NFS Running on Your System
 
 
       This section details how to install NFS and get it operating at your
       site.  This is a step-by-step description based on what was required to
       get NFS functioning at Perigon Solutions (formerly ACTC).
 
        1) Load the release software as described in section 6 "NFS Processor
           Update Tape" (page 6-1).
 
        2) Install the following NFS run units into :SYS: NFSD, NFSA, NFSU,
           :FUFORMAT, and :FUERRMSG.
 
           If you have an XPS as your UNIX FEP, copy RPCINFO into :SYS too.
 
        3) Copy :FUFORMAT into :FORMAT.:SYS, and add that command to your
           $XINSTALL file, or recreate your PO tapes with a modified :FORMAT.
 
        4) Only required for XPS systems: modify etc:services to include an
           entry for RPC.  For the SUN workstation the entry would look like
           the following:
 
           sunrpc          111/udp
           sunrpc          111/tcp
 
        5) Only required for multiple UNIX fep systems: Either define the FEP
           through which you want to run NFS as the DEFAULT in etc:routes; or
           create an NFS-specific etc:routes file, and set F$ROUTES to it
           before invoking NFSD.
 
        6) Create an etc:user_equiv file defining the users you want to have
           access to NFS.  Run the etc:user_equiv file through NFSA as defined
           in section 5 "Implementing User Authorization With NFSA".
 
        7) If your UNIX FEP is an XPS, modify etc:inetd_conf to include a login
           definition for RPCINFO.  If your UNIX FEP is not an XPS go to step
           8.  The following is an example of the format required:
 
           sunrpc/dolly stream tcp nowait :SYSTAC,SYS,passwd !RPCINFO
 
        8) Set up the NFSD logon entries in GOOSE as defined in the section
           "Invoking the NFSD System Ghost" on page 5-1.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       SRB_NFS            Getting NFS Running on Your System                6-6
           
 
 
 
 
 
        9) For DPX systems only, ensure that nfsd is not running on your DPX
           system - and that the DPX startup JCL will not invoke nfsd on the
           FEP.  NFS can not be run on a DPX system while that system is being
           used as a front-end for CP-6 NFS.
 
       10) Logon to your UNIX FEP as root, create a directory where the
           mounting will occur, and mount the CP-6 file system as described in
           section 5 "Mounting CP-6 File Systems Through NFS".  For example:
 
              cd /
              mkdir /nfs-mnt
              /etc/mount unix-fep-name:. /nfs-mnt
 
       NOTE:  You must ensure the etc:routes file and the SUPER defined RNAME
       for the FEP's device logon match (case sensitive).
