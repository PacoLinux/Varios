MULTIBAN.X is a banner program used for generating banners in
different fonts.
.*B*
 
!MULTIBAN.X [OVER ,lofid] (option, option, . . .)
.*B*
.*K* OPTIONS
Options in MULTIBAN are:
 
FONT     SIZE      TOP       DATE      DATE      TIME
DAY      AND       VERTICAL  HORIZONTAL          CENTER
NO_CENTER          SPACE     BLANK     RATIO     OVERSTRIKE
 
.*B*
Options are executed from left to right.  It is therefore legal to
specify a font, text, then another font, and still more text. The first
text will be printed out in the first font, and the second text string
will be printed out in the second font.
 
The banner is output through M$LO, which can be a file or line printer.
The default M$LO assignment is ME.
 
The file that contains the fonts is read through M$FONT.  The default
name is XG$FONT.:LIBRARY; this file is shipped with the CP-6 graphics
system.
 
To get help with a particular option, type:
!HELP (MULTIBAN.X) OPTIONS option_name
 
Or, type "??" to get help for all options.
