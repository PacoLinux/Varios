.*A*                                                                           
EFM allows you (if you have access) to examine and modify error
    message files.
 
.*B* OVERVEIW
EFM allows one to change error message files. In order to modify
an error message file you need 3 things:
 
   1) An error message file made with EXTRACT.X
   2) Write access to the error message file (if you are going to
       modify it, otherwise read access will let you to looksee
       only)
   3) The error message file should contain an STI record in it.
 
.*B* INVOKING
Invoking EFM:
 
Form1:
 
   !EFM.X
 
     Invoke the processor EFM. It is assumed that the user will issue
         an EFM command specifying an error message file later in the
         EFM session.
 
Form2:
 
   !EFM.X fid  [UTS=version]
 
     Invoke the processor, open the error message file specified by
        fid. Optionally (if specified) the STI version and specified
        version are checked for a possible match. If uts is specified
        and it does not match the STI one, the file is not opened.
 
See COMMANDS for more information.
 
.*K* COMMANDS
The following is a list of EFM commands, and a short description on
what they do. See the appropriate commands for detailed explanation.
 
   Command           Does
   --------------------------------------------------------
   LIST              List all previous times that this error
                       message file has been modified with
                       EFM
 
   STI               Display the STI record for this error
                       message file
 
   ADD <key>         Add error message to error message file
 
   MODIFY <key(s)>   Modify the following error messages that
                       correspond to the following key(s)
 
   DELETE <key(s)>   Delete the error messages that correspond
                       to the following key(s)
   DUMP <key(s)>     Make a pretty listing of the error message
                       using the specified keys.
 
   FIND 'string'     Find the specified string, can contain wild
                       cards.
 
   FCGS              List all the functional code groups in the error
                       message file.
 
   SET MONITOR BIT   Sets the bit in the error file key that specifies
                       that this is a monitor error message. All sub-
                       sequent references using a key will automatic-
                       ally be assumed to be monitor messages.
 
   RESET MONITOR BIT Resets the bit in the error file key. All sub-
                       sequent refernces using a key will assume the
                       reference to not be a monitor message reference
 
   SUB = '<1 char>'  Specifies what the preprocessor character is. Un-
                     less specified, the default SUB cjaracter is '%'.
 
   END               Terminate the EFM run.
 
See the help on the individual commands for more information.
 
.*K* MODIFY
MODIFY
 
M/ODIFY fcg-code#-mess#-seq# 'text'[,LAST,MONITOR]
 
MODIFY can change the text, LAST bit, and MONITOR bit of the specified
error message key. The key must already exist in the file, otherwise an
error message will be printed since there is no key to modify.
 
If LAST and MONITOR are not specified in the modification then these
bits are not changed from what they were previously.
 
If the new LAST bit does not match the old one a warning message is
printed stating so.
 
Related command: ADD, DELETE
 
.*K* ADD
ADD
 
A/DD  fcg-code#-mess#-seq# 'text' [,LAST,MONITOR]
 
The add command adds NEW records to the error message file. It will not
overwrite old messages. Use DELETE or MODIFY if the key already exists.
 
The bits LAST and MONITOR are set if specified by the programmer. Otherwise
these values take on the values of the last operation. If this is the
first operation then these bits default settings take on those values
as encountered in the very fi sequential record in the file.
 
The + character is used to indicate that there is more text to be
supplied for the error message. The + option allows the programmer
to supply up to 255 lines of text without specifying the associated
keys. For example, examine the following example:
 
  ADD @@@-100-0-0 'This is line #1',+
                  'line #2',+
                  'line #3',+
                  'line #4',+
                  'last line.'
 
In the example 6 lines of text, representing messages for keys:
@@@-100-0-0  - @@@-100-0-4 have been input to the file without having
to specify the new key each time. Notice that "LAST" was not
specified on the last line. When adding multi-sequence messages using
the + option the "LAST" line is logically the text following + records
that has no + option appended to it.
 
The fcg specifies the 2 to 3 character FCG. The code# can be any number
from 0-2^14-1. The message number can be any number from 0-7. The
seq# can be any number from 0-255.
 
Related commands: MODIFY, DELETE
 
.*K* DELETE
DELETE
 
DEL/ELETE fcg-code#-mess#-seq# [-fcg-code#-mess#-seq#]
 
This command will delete the record or records specified by the keys.
 
Related commands: ADD, MODIFY
 
.*K* FCGS
FCGS
 
[PRINT] FCGS
 
This command will tell you what functional code groups exist in the error
message file being studied.
 
Related command: STI
 
.*K* STI
STI
 
Command: STI
 
This command will print the error message files Software Technical
Identifier (STI) record.
 
This command will tell you what product this error message file is associated
with by file name, product name, version, and will tell you the birth
day of this error message file.
 
Related command: FCGS
 
.*K* DUMP
DU/MP [fcg-code#-seq#-mess# [-fcg-code#-seq#-mess#]]
 
This command will dump all, one, or selected error messages found in the
error message file.
 
The listing that prints after this command will tell you the following
things:
 
If a capital M is seen in column one then this error message is a monitor
error message. If the 1st character is blank it is not a monitor error
message.
 
The next 4 fields are seperated by commas and display the error messages
fcg#,code#,mess#,seq#. The field that follows is the text.
 
Redundant code# are supressed in the listing.
 
.*K* END
 END
 
Command form: END
 
END terminates the EFM run.
 
.*K* FIND
FIND
 
FIND 'text-string'
 
The find command finds all occurances of the specified text string. The
text string may be wildcarded by using the question mark.
 
Related command: DUMP
 
.*K* EFM
EFM
 
EFM fid [UTS=version]
 
This command allows the user to close the current error message file
being worked on, then open the new error message file specified.
 
If the UTS=version is specified then the specified version must match the
STI version found in the error message file. Otherwise the file id not
opened.
 
Related command: END
 
.*K* SET_MONITOR_BIT
SET MONITOR BIT
 
Command form: SET MONITOR BIT
 
Tells the EFM processor that the user is going to refer to monitor
error message files whenever a key is specified.
 
Related command: RESET MONITOR BIT
 
.*K* RESET_MONITOR_BIT
RESET MONITOR BIT
 
Command form: RESET MONITOR BIT
 
Tells the EFM processor that the user os going to refer to non-monitor
error messages whenever a key is specified.
 
Related command: SET MONITOR BIT
 
.*K* SUB_CHAR
SUB_CHAR
 
Command form: SUB CHAR = '<character>'
 
Tells the processor which character is to be considered as the
pre-processor character. By deafult the character is: '%'.

.*K* COMPLAINTS
 
Welcome to the complaint department.
 
This is the first version of an error message file modifier proceesor.
Doubtless there are things that could be modified in the way the tool
works that would facilitate easier use. However, it the implementors
intention to supply you with a vehicle for making a system for patching
error message files today, not next year sometime.
 
If you have problems or suggestions on the use or even the philosphy of
how this processor works please pass the information along in STARLOG.
