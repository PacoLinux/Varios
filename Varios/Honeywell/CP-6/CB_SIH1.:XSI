CB is a Citizen's Band simulator and sample comgroup application.  It
is invoked with the IBEX command:
 
   !CB.:SYS [command_file]
 
There are fourty CB channels, numbered 1 - 40.
 
.*B*
Each user of CB is tuned to one of the 40 channels and may monitor as
many other channels as is desired.  Normally, any text entered is
broadcast to all other CB users that are tuned to or monitoring the
channel of the sender.  Word wrap is enabled, so it is unnecessary to
hit return to start a new line.
 
Commands may be entered by hitting break, then entering the command.
The commands are TUNE, MONITOR, UNMONITOR, LIST, HANDLE and END.  The
commands may all be abreviated to a single character.  For information
on the commands, type "!HELP (CB.:SYS) commandname".
 
.*K* TUNE
 
The TUNE command allows you to change the channel you are tuned to.
You always hear everything on this channel, and all your broadcasts go
out over this channel.  When you enter CB you will be tuned to channel
19.
 
Format:  TUNE channel#
 
.*K* MONITOR
 
The MONITOR command allows you to listen to channels other than the
one you are tuned to.  You may monitor any number of channels.
 
Format:  MONITOR channel#[,channel#...]
 
.*K* UNMONITOR
 
The UNMONITOR command allows you to turn off monitoring of one or more
channels.
 
Format:  UNMONITOR channel#[,channel#...]
 
.*K* LIST
 
The LIST command lists the account and handle (if any) of all
specified CB users.  If no channels are specified on the list command
then all current users of CB are listed.
 
Format:  LIST [channel#[,channel#...]]
 
.*K* HANDLE
 
The HANDLE command allows you to set your handle.  Your handle is
displayed in front of each message you broadcast.  If you don't have a
handle, your account will be displayed.
 
Format:  HANDLE Chicken Man
 
.*K* END
 
The END command exits from CB.
 
Format:  END
 
.*K* WINDOW
 
The WINDOW command opens a three line input window at the top of the
screen.  All input will then be displayed in the input window and all
output displayed in the window comprising the remainder of the screen.
 
Format:  WINDOW
 
.*K* COMMAND_FILE
 
When CB is invoked it will look for the command file specified on the
invocation line, or the file :CB_CMD in the current directory.
Records in the command file beginning with a double quote (") will be
broadcast on the currently tuned to channel.  All other records are
parsed as commands to CB.  This is a convenient way to set your
handle, or invoke the WINDOW command, for instance.
