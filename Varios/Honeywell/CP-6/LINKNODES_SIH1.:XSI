LINKNODES.X links PARTRGE object units into files so that they can be
dynamically read by processors.
.*B*
Invocation syntax:
 
.*R*
Form 1:
.*R*
!LINKNODES.X [command_file] [OVER ,listing_file]
 
.*R*
Form 2:
.*R*
!LINKNODES.X [OBJECT_FILES] [ (ON|OVER|INTO) [DEST_FILE][,LS_FILE]] [(options)]
 
If Form 1 is used, LINKNODES runs as a processor accepting commands.  If Form 2
is used, LINKNODES will attempt to link the object files and produce a
destination file according to the options specified.  The options and meanings
of the form 2 command correspond to the description of the "LINK" command.

LINKNODES 'links' PARTRGE object units into a single record in a file that may
be read at run-time into a pre-defined data segment, where it is then
referenced by X$PARSE.  This program creates 'linked' nodes in one of two
different forms.  The 'shared' form is a random file that when opened ACS=DSn
allows multiple users to share the same parse nodes in physical memory.  This
is the preferred method when more than one user needs the parse nodes
simultaneously.  The 'unshared' form is a keyed file with a single record with
the default key 'NODES'.  When this record is accessed, of course, it can only
be placed in a dynamic memory segment belonging only to a single user.
 
The file type for these files is 'Pn' (for Partrge nodes).

topic.
 
For a description of the commands available in LINKNODES.X, use the COMMANDS
help topic.  For help on a specific command use the commandname help topic.
 
.*K* FILEFORMAT
 
The file created by LINKNODES contains 4 major sections.  They are:
 
1. Heading
 
The heading information consists of the first four words which indicate: the
size in words of the node record, a word of zero, the offset in words to the
node timestamp, and the offset in words to the node name information.
 
2. Nodes
 
This variable length section consists of the actual nodes from the object units
making up the image.  The actual position of DEF'ed nodes in this table is
indicated in the name information section.
 
3. Node Name Information
 
This is a table containing the names of each of the DEF'ed nodes and its offset
from the 1st word of the node record.  This information is located from the
third word of the header.
.*B*
The first 18 bits of the word indicated by the node name information offset is
the number of DEF'ed names in this table.
 
Following the number of names in the table is 'n' entries which the following
PL6 declaration describe:
 
.*
.fif
.*R*
dcl  1  NENTRY      caligned based,
        2 OFFSET    ubin(18) caligned,
        2 L         ubin(9)  caligned,
        2 NAME      char(NENTRY.L) caligned;
 
.*
.fin
.*R*
Each NENTRY.NAME is immediately followed by another NENTRY.NAME until all of
the indicated entries have been found.
 
.*B*
4.  Node Timestamp Information
 
This is a six word entry that contains the following words:
 
i)   DATE as an sbin of the format DDMMYY (in decimal).
 
ii)  TIME as an sbin of the format HHMMSS66 (in decimal).
 
iii) A pointer to 'this' segment.
 
iv)  Severity associated with this image.
 
v)   Zero
 
vi)  Zero

.*K* LINK LINKNODES
Syntax:
.*
.fif
.*R*
 
                         {ON  }
LINK fid [,fid,...,fid]  {OVER} fid [( options )]
                         {TO  }
 
.*
.fin
.*R*
Parameters:
 
options    is a list of LINKNODES options separated by commas.  The options
that may be specified are: APL, DEBUG, MAIL, KEY, MAIL, SEGID, SEVERITY, SHARE
and WSID.  See these commands for their use.
 
.*R*
Description:
 
This command takes the list of PARTRGE object unit files and 'links' them into
a record in the specified output file.  The current settings of the SEGID and
SHARE commands are used to determine the segment number that the image is
loaded for and the type of file to be created.
 
.*K* SEGID
Syntax:
 
SEGID=segid
 
Parameters:
 
segid   indicates the name of a data segment that the image is to be loaded
into.  The legal names are: DS1, DS2, DS3, DS4, DS5, DS6, DS7, DS8, AS0, AS1
and AS2.  Note that optionally, any segid may be specified in octal, or a
number between 1 and 8 is treated as a reference to DS1 through DS8.
 
Description:
 
If the 'segid' parameter is not specified, the current value of the segid
parameter is displayed (its default value is DS6).  If the segid parameter is
specified, a subsequent LINK command creates a node file for that segment.
 
.*K* END QUIT
 
This command causes the LINKNODES program to exit.
 
.*K* SHARE
Syntax:
 
SHARE=(Yes|No)
 
Description:
 
If the share parameter is not specified, the current value of share is
displayed.  If the share parameter is specified, then the share file type of
the next node linked corresponds to this parameter.
 
.*K* MAP LIST
Syntax:
 
MAP  fid
.*R*
LIST fid
 
Description:
 
This command causes LINKNODES to read the specified file and display the file
name, the date this node record was created, the segment that it was created
for, the linking severity and the names of the nodes that are DEF'ed.
 
.*K* DEBUG
Syntax:
 
DEBUG=(No|Yes|APL)
 
Description:
 
This command forces the entry of a debug mode.  If the YES option is specified,
then while the nodes are being linked, debugging information is displayed.  The
No DEBUG option may be used to turn this information off.
 
The APL option enters APL command input mode.  A ')GO' command resumes
execution.
 
.*R*
.*K* STATUS
Syntax:
 
STATUS
 
Description:
 
This command causes LINKNODES to print the status of all of the options that
affect the creation of the node file.
 
.*K* WSID
Syntax:
 
WSID = (CLEAR WS | fid)
 
Description:
 
This command causes LINKNODES to remember the name of the workspace that was
specified.  When an END, QUIT or EXIT command is entered to leave LINKNODES,
the specified workspace will be loaded.
 
.*K* KEY
Syntax:
 
KEY = 'string'
 
Description:
 
When "SHARE=NO", LINKNODES will write the record containing the nodes into the
file with the specified key.  The default key is 'NODES'.
 
.*K* SEVERITY
Syntax:
 
SEVERITY = dec
 
Description:
 
This command specifies the maximum severity that the node file is permitted to
contain.  If the specified severity is exceeded, the LINKNODES file is not
created (or written).
 
.*K* MAIL
Syntax:
 
MAIL
 
Description:
 
This command is used as short form to create a node file suitable for mail
nodes.  This command is equivalent to entering the two commands:
 
.*R*
SHARE=YES
.*R*
SEGID=DS6
 
.*K* APL
Syntax:
 
APL
 
Description:
 
This command may be used as short form to create a node file suitable for the
APL system functions PARSE and GETCMD.  This command is equivalent to entering
the two commands:
 
.*R*
SHARE=NO
.*R*
SEGID=AS0

.*K* CHANGES

.*R*
Modified LINKNODES to use GETCMD and PARTRGE for command parsing.  Also added
the ability to use LINKNODES specifying the LINK options and files on the
command line without going into "command" mode.
