    CALENDAR is a tool which will help its user's daily life
    by building and displaying a personal calendar.  It will
    have four modes the user can enter to do these tasks.
    These modes will be fully described in this document.
    But first:
 
    To run CALENDAR, type !CALENDAR at the IBEX level.
    CALENDAR will then prompt with a colon (':') for a command.
 
    Followings are the CALENDAR commands and their descriptions
    and formats:
 
         ***In SCHEDULE, CANCEL, and CHANGE modes, CALENDAR
            will be highly interactive with the user by
            prompting the user what to enter as inputs.***

                   line may be edited as if it had just been
                   typed.  If the subject is 'NOTES' the
                   CALENDAR will build temporary file containing
                   the current notes and calls the standard
                   CP-6 line editor EDIT.  The notes may
                   be modified using any of the capabilities
                   of EDIT.  The END command to EDIT will
                   return control to CALENDAR, which
                   replaces the notes with the newly edited
                   notes.
