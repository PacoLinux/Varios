NATL is used to change the native language byte in the JIT.
NATL can be used one of two ways:
 
   o  To change the native language byte to a given character
           !NATL 'language-byte'
 
   o  To change the native language to a language name
           !NATL language-name
 
where:
   language-byte is the one byte character to be placed in the jit.
   language-name is the name of a language to be associated with
                    the one character language-byte.

Added some more error handing

There is some default language table stuff in the CRU file.
Languages are case insensitve.
Invocation w/o options prints the current language byte.
NATL doesn't need JIT priv to update translate table.

CHANGES
Sample usage:
 
   !NATL ' '=RESET    "makes !NATL RESET change native language to space
 
   !NATL 'D'=GERMAN   "associates GERMAN with the language byte D
   !NATL GERMAN       "changes the native language byte to D
 
   !NATL 'E'          "changes the native language byte to E
   o In order to work properly, NATL must be installed in the system
     account (:SYS) or be run from an account with JIT privilege.
 
   o The translation table may be updated by typing
     !NATL 'language-byte' = language-name
 
   o The translation table is stored inside the run-unit and must
     be updated by an account with write access to the run-unit.
     Note this access CANNOT be vehicular write.
