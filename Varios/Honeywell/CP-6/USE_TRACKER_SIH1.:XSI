USE_TRACKER is a routine that can be called by an application program to track
and log information about the application program's user.
.*B*
The calling sequence for USE_TRACKER is:
 
      CALL USE_TRACKER (character_string,character_count)
 
Where
 
character_string    is a valid CP-6 FID (that will be passed to M$FID
inernally)
 
and
 
character_count     is a UBIN WORD count of the characters in character_string
 
.*B*
When USE_TRACKER is called it opens the passed FID.  If the FID doesn't exist,
and the user can create the file, it is created and the headings are placed in
the begining of the file.
