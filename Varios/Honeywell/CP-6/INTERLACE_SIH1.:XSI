INTERLACE is a tool used to combine a WEB source and update file to
produce a new WEB source file.
.*B*
Command syntax:
 
  !INTERLACE.X fid1,fid2 {TO|ON|OVER|INTO} fid3
 
where:
 fid1 - the original WEB source file
 fid2 - the WEB update file
 fid3 - the updated WEB source file
.*B*
Although INTERLACE was developed for use in LADC integration procedures
for programs written in WEB, it could also be used to apply WEB-style
updates to an aribitrary source file.
 
A WEB update file consists of any number of update packets, each of
the form:
 
    @x [comments]
    line(s) to be replaced
    @y [comments]
    replacement line(s)
    @z [comments]
 
Update packets must appear in the order they are to be applied to the
source file.  Each group of lines replaced must be large enough to
uniquely identify to update location, starting with the source line
following the end of the previous update.
