FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
COPYALT is used to copy an indexed or IREL file with alternate indexes while
preserving the order of duplicate keys in an alternate index.
.*B*
COPYALT is invoked as:
 
!COPYALT.X sifile {ON|TO|INTO|OVER} oufile
 
There are no options.
 
.*B*
Normally, if PCL is used to copy a file with alternate indexes, the order of
duplicate keys is not preserved.  The result with PCL is that the order of
duplicate keys will be the same as the order of the primary index.
 
COPYALT can be used to copy a file if the order of duplicate keys needs to be
preserved.  This is done by writing records to the "oufile" in the same order
that they were written originally to the "sifile".  COPYALT should only be used
when this is absolutely necessary, since COPYALT will take at least twice as
long as a PCL copy.
