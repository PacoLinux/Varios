FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

GRAFAGANT creates single-page Gantt charts using CP-6 graphics.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRAFAGANT.X [input_file] OVER graphics_file[,listing_file][(options)]
 
(at the moment, there are several incarnations of GRAFAGANT in .X; GRAFAGANT
(for the laserprinter), GRAFAGANTDEC (for the DECVT125 and DECVT241),
GRAFAGANTTEK (for 4010-compatibles) and GRAFAGANTDMP (for the HIDMP29).  Use
the version that matches the device you are using.)
 
where:
 
input_file     is a file of GRAFAGANT input in the format described below.
[Default is to prompt for data from the terminal.] DCB is F$105.
 
graphics_file  is the place you want the graphics to go; it must be specified.
DCB is GRAPHICS00.
 
listing_file   is the place you want the GRAFAGANT "LO" to go to.  If you're
reading an input_file from a file, you probably want to say NO for this.  DCB
is F$108.
 
options are:
               BORDER - to create a 5% border around your chart.
               FRAME  - to draw a "frame" around the active plotting area.
.*B*
Inputs are in a certain order:
 
1) Title of chart, 80 characters
 
2) Subtitle of chart, 80 characters
 
3) Note text for lower-right hand corner, 40 characters
 
4) range of dates for chart, must be starting,ending date
     for example: 01/01/85,01/01/86
 
5) Data items.  There are two formats for data items:
 
a) time line items are in the form
  'activity title',date1,date2
 
  for example:
  'Do the painting',06/01/85,07/01/85
 
  date1 must be less than date2
 
b) milestone items are in the form
  'activity title',date,date,{'M1'|'M2'}
 
  for example:
  'Genl Rls',07/07/86,07/07/86,'M1'
 
  activity titles should be short, 4-8 characters
  date and date must be equal (i.e. the same date)
  items with M1 go on an "upper" milestone line
  items with M2 go on a "lower" milestone line
 
If there is no milestone data, no milestone lines will print.  If data for only
one milestone line exists, only one mileston line will print.

GRAFAGANT uses the CP-6 DIGS graphics system, which is a separately priced
product.  If you don't have it, maybe you should!  It's not that expensive.
