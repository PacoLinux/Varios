UNPRINT reports on the existence of unprintable characters in TEXT or other
source files.
Simply type
 
   !UNPRINT.X <filename> [{TO|ON|OVER|INTO}, <listing>] [(options)]
 
where
 
 filename      is the name of your source input file
 
 listing       is the optional name of where to place the UNPRINT report
 
 options       can be
 
     NHT       meaning "don't tell me about embedded tab characters"
     NBS       meaning "don't tell me about embedded backspace characters"
 
Due to line noise or fumble-fingered typing, unprintable characters sometimes
creep into source or character-data files.  Since EDIT "prints" these
unprintable characters and the FEP (usually) doesn't translate them, it is
difficult to determine which records have the bad characters (if any) and where
they are.  Obviously, PCL can be used to print the file in octal to locate the
unprintable characters, but this method is time-consuming if the file is large.
 
UNPRINT can be used to locate the unprintable characters quickly.
 
UNPRINT will locate every unprintable character in the file and report it,
describing the record number or EDIT key, the character found, and the column
(relative to 1) it found it in.  If NBS is specified as an option, backspace
characters (O'010') will not be reported as unprintable characters.  If NHT is
specified as an option, horizontal tab characters (O'011') will not be reported
as unprintable characters.
 
UNPRINT is a simple-minded program.  It doesn't work with files other than
EDIT-keyed or consecutive files.  The maximum record length is 2048 bytes.

05/13/91 MII #40433
Made UNPRINT make an output file even with strangely spaced command line.
08/14/87 Increased buffer size for data to 2K bytes.
09/03/85 Added the ASCII character name (eg. FF) to the display for
         characters less than a space (O'040').
10/07/83 Just bored on a Friday afternoon, so changed display format.
07/11/83 Changed display format so it isn't so wordy.
