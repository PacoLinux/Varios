RUDD Removes Unwanted Duplicate Data records from a file, guaranteeing that the
ones that are left are unique.
Full command line syntax:
 
!RUDD.X file [(COUNT,COL(column_list))]
 
where:
 
file is a pre-sorted file (records can be up to 256 bytes long)
 
column_list are pairs of columns to be searched for matching information.  Up
to 6 pairs of column-identifiers may be specified.
 
COUNT indicates that you want the count of duplicated records to be placed in
the output file.
RUDD reads each record in the input file and writes the unique records back out
into the same file, EDIT-keying the file as it goes.  By default, RUDD compares
adjacent records, and rejects duplicate records.  If the optional column-pairs
are specified, RUDD will only compare those columns to determine if subsequent
records should be rejected.  Note that the FIRST occurence of a unique record
is written to the output file (not the LAST).
 
As an example, let's assume you have a list of names and addresses and you
would like to guarantee that there's only one occurrence of each person in the
file.  (You stole someone else's phone list and merged it with yours.)  Let's
assume that the people's names are in columns 1 through 30.  So,
 
     !C somefile OVER somefile(RECS=140)
     !SORT somefile OVER somefile
     REC INL=140
     KEY S=1,L=30
     END
     !RUDD.X somefile(COL(1,30))
 
Now, somefile will have a record for each person.  Note the use of the (1,30)
option for RUDD.  That means "only check columns 1 through 30 for the
comparison information".
 
As another example, let's assume that you'd like to see what the set of TEXT
directives is that's currently in use in all of your documents.  You could then
use this sequence:
 
     !C ?docfiles? INTO somefile(NLN)
     !E
     C somefile
     IF NOT/./,1,1;DE
     END
     !C somefile OVER somefile (RECS=80)
     !SORT somefile OVER somefile
     REC INL=80
     KEY S=1,L=4
     END
     !RUDD.X somefile
 
Now, somefile will contain single occurrences of all the TEXT directives you
use.  (I know this is wierd, but it really is a real-life example.)

rudd, n. a teleostean fish of Europe, of the genus Cyprinus, with a deep body
like a bream, but thicker, a prominent back, and a small head.  The back is an
olive color; the sides and belly yellow, marked with red; the ventral and anal
fins and tail of a dep red color.  Also called a redeye.
Finally, if you specify the COUNT option, 8 bytes are added at the beginning of
output records.  The first 5 bytes are the count of duplicate records, followed
by three bytes of separator (' * '). So the input file:
 
     aaa
     aaa
     bbb
 
would result in the output file
 
   2 *      aaa
   1 *      bbb
 
If the COUNT option is used.
