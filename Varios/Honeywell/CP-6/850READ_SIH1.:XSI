850READ transfers data from Xerox 850 word processor diskettes to CP-6 files.
.*B*
Syntax:
    !850READ.X [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO} filename]
.*B*
850READ reads a transmission from a Xerox 850 word processor functioning in
communications mode and copies it to a CP-6 keyed file.  The correct profile
for the 850 device is XRX850, and the 850 must be set up in "TTY"
communications mode.  To transfer files, set the 850 disket file up for
transmission according to the instructions provided with the device.  Then
issue the 850READ command to CP-6, followed by an <ESC><P>.  When the
transmission is completed, type <ESC><F> to close the CP-6 file.
