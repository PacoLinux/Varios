DIPRO.X displays the names of PROFILEs available on CP-6.  Unlike the IBEX
DI PROFILE command, DIPRO accepts wildcarded names as well as selection by
profile type (ASYNC,3270,URP,etc.).

Invocation syntax:
 
  !DIPRO.X [profile-name] [,profile-file] [{ON|OVER}, listing-file] [(options)]
 
profile-name  - name, possibly wildcarded, of the profiles to display
profile-file  - the name of the CP-6 file that contains the profiles
                to be searched.  If not specified, :PRO.:SYS will be searched.
 
options are:                                      Default:
 
     3/270                                        No
