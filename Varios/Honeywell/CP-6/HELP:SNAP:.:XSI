The dumpfile produced by SNAP is a normal CP-6 dumpfile that may be looked at
with ANLZ.  The M$SCREECH pmme is used to get the dumpfile which will contain
the specified user's and monitor's context.  The contents of the dumpfile may
be altered by changing the invocation of VLP_SCODE in the source code in
include or exclude certain items.

SNAP requires the EXMM (EXtended Memory Management) privilege be active.
SNAP has the ability to attempt to SUA (Single User Abort) the specified
user(s) after taking a snapshot dump.  This is not a substitute for the X keyin
and under certain circustances, (user having a gate locked, user system ghost,
etc.), may result in a full screech.  It is intended that the SUA option is to
be used only if other means of deleting the user have failed.  A snapshot is
taken of the user before the sua that can be used to determine why the user got
"stuck".  SNAP accomplishes the SUA by blanking out the user's tstack, so the
dump produced by the monitor for the sua will usally be of little value, thus
the pre-sua snapshot.  Using SNAP to just take snapshot dumps of users is not
dangerous and may be done at any time without harm to the system.
