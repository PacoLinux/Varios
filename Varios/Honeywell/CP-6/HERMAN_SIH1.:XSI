.*K* INPUT SOURCE                                             
 
This document describes the source input format for HERMAN, the HELP
munger.  Note that this format is similar to that of error messages.
As error messages are derived from the appropriate programme's source
code, help messages may be derived from the appropriate programme's
TEXT compatible manual input.
.*B*
 
HERMAN directives are placed in TEXT comment fields, so each one
will start with a '.*' in the first column.  A '~' may be substituted
for '.' in this construct.  A HERMAN directive that defines a HELP message will
use as data for that message, all the records following the directive until the
next TEXT comment record.
.*B* MODULE
 
MODULE ID
 
The module ID must appear once, at the beginning of the TEXT file.
The module id is primarily for documentation of the munger input.
HERMAN also builds a topic in the output database.  The keyword is
such that the information will follow the default HELP message in
the database.
 
Module name is indicated by a line starting with '.*M*'.  The mname and
explanation follow.  The section is delimited by the next TEXT-style
comment field.  For example:
       .*M*
       PEEK.X
       PEEK lets a user without SPY equipment list the JOB and output
       streams for his own (logon) account.
       .*
 
.*B* COPYRIGHT
 
COPYRIGHT NOTICE
 
The copyright notice is required.  It should appear soon after the
module name.
 
The copyright is primarily for documentation of the munger input.
HERMAN also builds a topic in the output database.  The keyword is
such that the information will follow the default HELP message in
the database.
 
The copyright starts with the line '.*T*' and ends with the next
TEXT-style comment.  For example:
       .*T*
        **************************************************************
        *                                                            *

.*B* ABSTRACT
 
ABSTRACT
 
The '.*A*' construct introduces an abstract.
 
The abstract is partially for documentation of the munger input.
It is also used to define a default message.  This is the message that
the HELP service is to print when the user types 'HELP' without
specifying any keywords.  Since this is most likely to be used
by the novice user, the first level message should inform the user
how to use '?'.  The abstract should also point the user to a
topic that fully describes HELP.
 
The default message generated by abstract may be given synonyms by
placing them on the line after '.*A*', similar to normal topics.
Breaks are also permitted, but without keywords or synonyms.  For example:
       .*A*
       CP-6 Peripheral Conversion Language (PCL) is a flexible and powerful
       utility processor that provides information movement between various
       sources and destinations in the CP-6 system or network.
       Type '?' for more information.
       .*B*
       PCL features are....
 
       Type 'HELP HELP' for more information on the HELP facility.
       .*
.*B* KEYWORDS
 
KEYWORDS
 
The KEYWORD line is ignored by TEXT as a comment, but tells HERMAN the
munger that the following text is to be included in the HELP database
under the given topic name.  Note that synonyms for the topic name may
follow it on the command line.  For example:
       .*K* COPY KOPY MOVE
       text for COPY command HELP
       .*
.*B* BREAKS SUBTOPICS
 
DATA BREAKS
 
Data breaks serve several purposes:
  1) indicate to M$HELP that the current chunk of HELP is over.  The
     user should hit '?' or '??' to get the next piece of text.
  2) apply a subkeyword to the following section so that the user can
     randomly access the HELP without reading through the previous
     text.
  3) apply several synonymous subkeywords.
The syntax is:
       .*B* [ [subkeyword] [synonym] ... ]
For example:
       .*B* EXAMPLE SAMPLE USAGE
  and  .*B*
.*B* RESUME CONDITIONAL_INPUT
 
RESUME HERMAN
 
The RESUME directive is a comment to TEXT, but tells HERMAN to resume
building the HELP database where it left off.  This is handy when just
a few lines of a TEXT file are to be processed by HERMAN.  Example:
       .*M*
       STASH
       STASH is a processor that builds XEQ records.
       .*
       additional text for use by TEXT
       .*R*
       It lives in the X account.
       .*
After the RESUME directive, HERMAN continues as if the interruption had
not occured.

       .*K* COPY TRANSFER MOVE
       .*B* SYNTAX FORMAT
       Syntax:  C[OPY] srce[,srce]... [{TO|ON|OVER|INTO} dest] [FROM fid]
       .*B* PARTS
         srce = source; typically file name with options. Type HELP SOURCE.
         TO   = if destination file exists, abort.
         ON   = if destination file exists, abort.
         OVER = delete previous destination file.
         INTO = merge with previous destination file.
         dest = destination; typically file name with options.
                    Type HELP DESTINATION.
         FROM fid = default fid for source parameters. Type HELP FROM.
       .*B* USAGE PURPOSE
       COPY transfers data between peripherals.  Data is collected from the
       disk files, tape files, devices, and oplabels defined in the source
       parameters and copied to the disk file, tape file, or device defined in
       the destination parameter. TO and ON prevent overwrites if the
       destination is a file.  INTO appends records to an existing consecutive
       or relative file, but merges records into a keyed file (if possible).
       .*B* EXAMPLE SAMPLE
       Example: C FILEA.SHAW.SECRET OVER FILEB..SECURE
         means copy file FILEA (in account SHAW with password SECRET) over any
         existing FILEB (in user's directory account with password SECURE).
       Example: COP LT#1234 TO DP#MYSET/FILEZ(ACS=((BASIC,EDIT),READ))
         means copy the contents of labeled tape #1234 to file FILEZ on the
         packset MYSET,; file access is limited to BASIC and EDIT, which can
         only read the file (no record replacement, deletion, etc.).
       Example: COPY ?GOAT?(TY=(SE)) TO GOATMASTER(CRPT=777) FROM DP#MYSET/..QQ
         means select from DP#MYSET all files of type SE (Source Edit) whose
         names contain the string GOAT. Use a password QQ. Collect all
         qualifying files into a single file GOATMASTER which is encrypted
         using the seed 777.

.*A* INVOCATION SYNTAX
HERMAN is invoked as follows:
   !HERMAN.X source [,update] {OVER} [database] [,list] [(option_list)]
                              {ON  }
                              {TO  }
                              {INTO}
.*B*
   'source' is the HERMAN-readable source input
   'update' is the update file to be aplied to source.
   'database' is the file where HERMAN is to put the constructed HELP
              data.
   'list' is the destination for a listing of all the records con-
              sidered source by HERMAN.  This includes text and
              HERMAN directives.
   'option_list' is a list of options separated by commas.  Valid
                 options are:
           CH/ATTER - talk about what's going on.
           WA/RN - print all warning messages.
           LS - list source.
           SU/MMARY - print summary of record types encountered.
           OU - create a M$HELP database.
           ER/EDUNDANT - Eliminate redundant synonyms.  Synonyms that simply
                 insure that an abbreviation will refer to the desired topic
                 or subtopic are redundant if the desired topic is next in the
                 database anyway.  This option should be turned off for all but
                 the last if the HELP file is built from multiple source files.
                 NOTE:  All options may be turned ON by specifying
                        the above keywords.  The options may be
                        turned OFF by specifying the above keywords
                        with 'N' tacked on the beginning.  The
                        default for all these options is ON.
 
DCBs used:  M$SI - source
            M$UI - update
            M$OU - database
            M$LO - listing
            M$ME - commentary, summary, and error messages

LIMITS AND RESTRICTIONS
 
Due to the nature of the HELP database, there may be no more than
512 lines of text per subtopic of help.  There may be no more than
512 subtopics per topic.
