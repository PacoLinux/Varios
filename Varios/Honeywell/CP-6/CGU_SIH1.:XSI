CGU, a comgroup utility, is used to perform the following functions on a
comgroup :
 
  1. Open a comgroup, optionally as the AU.
  2. Display
            * comgroup parameters
            * users/stations associated with the comgroup
            * all or selected messages associated with the comgroup
            * comgroup statistics
  3. Perform all or any subset of the above displays repetitively.
  4. Delete all or selected messages from the comgroup.
  5. Modify comgroup parameters.
  6. Monitor comgroup activity.
  7. Create comgroups.
  8. Extend comgroups.
  9. Dump all or selected messages in the comgroup.

.*K* DISPLAY display DI di
Syntax :  D[ISPLAY] [(ALL | parameter_list)]
 
where
 ALL            requests that all comgroup parameters be displayed and
 parameter_list is an optional list of comgroup parameters.  For a description
                of those parameters that may be specified, see the Monitor
                Services Reference Manual for a description of M$CGINFO,
                VLP_CGCP and VLP_SETSTA.  Note that the WAS parameter in

         not specified, the command is executed just once.
 station is the name of a station.  If the STATION parameter is not specified,
         all stations are listed.
 
The command displays information on stations associated with the comgoup
currently opened.

The defaults are Q=ALL, T=?, O=?, D=?, M=0.
 
The command may be used to display all or selected messages from the
comgroup currently open.  One must be the AU of the comgroup or have AURD
access to the comgroup.  Note that one specifying a message idlist that
m- means list all messages with IDs >= m and -n means list all messages with
IDs <= n.

where option_list is one or more of the following :
 
  AU=(Y[ES] | N[O])
  STAN[AME]=station_name_for_au

                    and the possible values that they may be set to, see the
                    Monitor Services Manual for a description of M$CGINFO,

                    VLP_SETSTA as SETSTAWAS.
 
The command may be used to modify any of the comgroup parameters defined in
VLP_CGCP or in the default SETSTA defined using VLP_SETSTA.  One must be the AU

where
 
where
 
 fid     is the comgroup to be extended
 extension is the number of granules to extend the specified comgroup
 
The command may be used to extend the size of a comgroup.  The comgroup remains
open after the extension so that other CGU commands may be utilized without the
necessity of the CG command.

where
 
  option_list may be one or more of the following :

where
 
 dest    is the destination station name
 origin  is the station of origin
 type    is the message type

command.  Note that when one specifies a message idlist that m- means to
delete all messages with IDs >= m and that -n means to delete all messages
with IDs <= n.
.*B*
Example :  D T=TRANSTYP
.*K* ADD add
Syntax :  ADD parm_list
 
where parm_list is one or more of the following :
 
       ALL, P[ARAMETERS], U[SERS], M[ESSAGES] or S[TATS]
 
The command is used to add items to be displayed when the GO command
is invoked.  If PARAMETERS is on, then the comgroup parameters are displayed.
If USERS is on, then the users/stations associated with the currently open
comgroup are displayed.  If MESSAGES is on, then the messages associated with
the currently open comgroup are displayed.  If STATS is on, then statistics for
the currently open comgroup are displayed.
.*K* DROP drop
Syntax :  DR[OP] parm_list
 
where parm_list is one or more of the following :
 
       ALL, P[ARAMETERS], U[SERS], M[ESS] or S[TATS]
 
The command is used to drop items to be displayed when the GO
command is invoked.  See the ADD command.
.*K* GO go
Syntax :  G[O] [inc]
 
where inc is the number seconds to wait before the requested display is
          repeated.
 
The command is used to display those items that have been ADDed to the display
list.  If inc is not specified, the items are displayed once.  See the ADD
command.
.*K* DUMP DUC DUA DUO dump duc dua duo
Syntax : (DU[MP] | DUO | DUA | DUC) [option_list]
 
where option_list may be one or more of the following :
 
   D[ESTINATION] = (? | dest)
   O[RIGIN] = (? | origin)
   T[YPE] = (? | type)
   M[SGID] = idlist
 
where
    dest       is the destination station name.  Note this parameter must be
               specified to dump messages directed to particular stations.
               The default is ? which forces the anonymous queue to be read.
    origin     is the station of origin.
    type       is the message type.
    idlist     is the message ID list made up of one or more of the following :
               m, m-, m-n or -n where m and n are decimal numbers.
 
The command may be used to dump all or selected messages from the comgroup.
The messages will be displayed in ASCII (DUC), in octal (DUMP or DUO) or in
octal with ASCII translation (DUA).  Note as messages are read from the
comgroup to be displayed they are unlatched with HOLD (HOLDSTA=CGU_HOLD).
At the termination of the command, the messages are unheld and the original
HOLDSTA is restored.  If the system crashes during execution of the DUMP
command, it may be necessary to restore the previous HOLDSTA (the HOLDSTA
for TP is HOLDSTA).  To do so, use the LET HOLDSTA HOLDSTA command which
will, in addition to restoring the HOLDSTA to HOLDSTA, release all messages
that are held by CGU_HOLD.
.*B*
Examples :
DUA TYP=XYZ            dumps all messages with type=XYZ that are not directed
                       to any particular station in octal with ASCII
                       translation.
DUO M=3-23             dumps in octal all messages that have an ID between 3
                       and 23 that are not directed to any particular station.
DUC TYP=ABC,DEST=EZ    dumps in ASCII all messages with type=ABC that are
                       directed to station EZ.
