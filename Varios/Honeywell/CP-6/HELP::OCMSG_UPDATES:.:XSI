:OCMSG_UPDATES is a file that contains altered operator console templates.
To use, you must have write access to .:SYS.  Then:
 
!C :OCMSG_UPDATES.X INTO :OCMSG.:SYS(SHARE)
 
Many customers have requested that certain "features" be standard in operator
console messages; for example, bells on important messages.  This file fulfills
many of those requests by utilizing an interesting builtin mechanism in KEYIN.
The file actually contains templates for various console messages in "alternate
native languages".  There are templates for several "native languages" in this
file.  By using the !NATL keyin, the operator can get the templates required.
 
!NATL S
 
"Signal" - this set of templates is a subset of existing templates, with the
only change being that bells are inserted on messages that require operator
intervention.
 
!NATL Q
 
"Quiet" - this set of templates is also replaces existing templates.  The
changes here, however, are much more extensive.  Based on input from the
operations staff at LADC, these templates eliminate the "chatter" that is most
often ignored on consoles.  Additionally, this native language contains
messages with bells on them, for conditions requiring operator intervention.
 
!NATL M
 
"Mute" - simple subset of quiet that squelches the Fprg on/off messages and
device connect/disconnect messages.
 
!NATL E
 
Real, honest-to-god, Spanish templates of the most common messages.
 
!NATL D
 
Real, honest-to-god, German templates of the most common messages.
 
!NATL
 
Resets the templates to the standard default.

CHANGES
**** This section is intended for the system manager installing the templates
***.
 
The source for these modified templates has been provided as
:OCMSG_UPDATES_SIT1.:XSI.   If the actions taken on certain messages under
certain native language conditions is not desired, that message can be deleted
from the file (or EDITed) and the :OCMSG_UPDATES_CRU.:XSI job can be rerun.
Then, copy the file INTO a fresh copy of the released :OCMSG.:SYS.  It is not
recommended that you update the :OCMSG file before it is placed on the PO tape.
There is no method of deleting templates from the file, only updating them.
Therefore you must start with a fresh copy of the released :OCMSG every time.
 
At LADC, we install these templates after every 'S' or 'Y' type boot.
 
Also, you may want to modify the console definitions to have a CMD (setup)
string if you want a certain native language to be default.  If you already
have a CMD on a console, you can use KEYINs !READ fid capability to get more
than one CMD executed on console connect.
John Joseph, LADC
The default native language for all templates released by Bull is space.
The native language of a template is the character enclosed in quotes before
the template number.  For example:
 
/'Q'/41= ......
 
41 is the template number, and Q is the native language.  As released, the
console templates with a native language of space (the defaults) work as
intended.  Should a site replace these default templates, they are making a
modification to their system that may render it unsupportable.  It is therefore
recommended that the native languages of the templates in this file not be
modified.
 
As issued, these updated templates do not replace any of the supported, default
templates.
