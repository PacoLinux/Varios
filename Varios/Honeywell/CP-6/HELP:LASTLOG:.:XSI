                         LASTLOG
 
LASTLOG is a program that can be used as part of your !SETUP procedure to
execute/ship portions of the file based on whether or not you've logged on
previously that day.  This is handy if, for example, you use CALENDAR.X and you
only want to see today's messages the first time you log on.
 
To invoke LASTLOG:
 
    !LASTLOG.X
    !IF STEPCC>0 THEN GOTO logged-on-once
    !first-time-logged-on
 
LASTLOG sets STEPCC to 0 ("false") if you have NOT logged on today; it sets it
to non-zero ("true") if you have logged on today.  IBEX IF commands can then be
used to control execution of succeeding steps.
 
LASTLOG builds and maintains a file :PROFILE in your logon account to keep
track of the last logon date.  The file contains one keyed record.  If you
delete the file, LASTLOG assumes you haven't logged on today the next time it
is called.
 
[The function of LASTLOG should probably be taken over by "user profiles" in
C00.]

The above file invokes CALENDAR.X for a display of today's schedule only on the
first logon; MAIL is called on every logon to list new messages.
