CALENDAR is a tool which will help the user's daily life by building and
displaying a personal calendar.  The name of the file used to store a
personal calendar is :CALENDAR.
 
CALENDAR also supports group calendars. These are composite calendars
summarizing the entries in the personal calendars of all users who are
attached to the group.
 
CALENDAR is invoked with the command:
 
    !CALENDAR.X [.acct]
 
If ".acct" is specified or the M$CALENDAR DCB is set to another account
then the :CALENDAR file in that account will be used.  Otherwise the
:CALENDAR file in the users logon account is accessed.  CALENDAR will
prompt with a colon (":").
 
Type 'HELP COMMANDS' for a list of CALENDAR commands.

Type 'HELP USING_GROUPS' for more information on group calendars.

.*K* USING_GROUPS
A group calendar is a composite calendar summarizing the contents of the
personal calendars for all members of the group.  Any member of a group
can display the composite schedule for part or all of the group to help
find a convenient time to schedule an event.
 
Group calendars are maintained by the members of the group.  Any user
can start a group (CREATE command) or make themselves a member of an
existing group (ATTACH command). A user can also remove himself from a
group he is attached to at any time (DETACH command).
 
Once attached to a group, all additions or changes to the user's
personal calendar are automatically applied to the group calendar.  Any
member of the group can display the composite schedule for a given date
or range of dates (GROUP command). The display can be for the entire
group, or the schedule for selected group members can be displayed.  It
is also possible to list the members of a group (MEMBERS command).

.*B*
Group calendars are designed primarily to assist users in finding a
convenient time to schedule an event.  Typically, a group would be set
up for a small set of people who need to communicate with each other
about their work planning and scheduling. By displaying the group
calendar, any member of the group can see when the other group members
are free and when they are busy. In this way, group calendars make it
easier to resolve schedule conflicts when a meeting or other event
affects several group members.
 
The group calendar facility is intended as an aid in scheduling, but it
is not a universal scheduling or work planning system. The group
calendar simply tells the user that a group member is busy at a given
time; it does not tell how long he will be busy or for what reason.
Also, group members must keep their personal calendars complete and up
to date for the facility to be effective. Any potential conflicts must
be resolved outside of the system. Once a convenient time for an event
is found, it must be scheduled as is currently done.
 
    Type '?' for more information.
.*B*
A user is known within a group by an "alias" supplied when he is
attached to the group. An alias consists of up to 15 alphabetic
characters and a period can be used for punctuation. For example,
"Tony", "T.Jones", and "DeForrest" are vaild aliases.
 
A user can be attached to up to 10 groups at a time.  There is no limit
to the number of members in a single group.
 
If a user is attached to more than one group, group calendar commands
must specify which group to access. The desired group can be indicated
by giving the FID for the group calendar file or by using the symbolic
name assigned to the group. This name is specified when the group is
created and can contain any characters legal in a FID.  The creator of a
group calendar should assign it a simple, meaningful name so that users
need not remember the full FID and account of the group file.
 
When CALENDAR is started, a display is produced showing all group
calendars that the user is attached to, their names, and the user's
alias in the group.
