 
A - Records and reports job status into/from a file
 
To run: !A.X [ fid ] [ ,input ] [ ON,output ] [ (...commands) ]
 
     "A" reads from M$SI (#2), writes through M$ME (#4), and
     records information into M$$JOB (#1).
 
     Input records consist of SYSID followed by optional comments.
 
     The SYSID and the comments will be recorded into a keyed file
     with default name of $$JOB.current-fma.
 
     "A" will prompt you for SYSIDs or commands. The commands are
     as follows:
 
          1. EN/D or E/XIT or Q/UIT or X - close file nd exit.
 
          2. R/EPORT - report, delete those records for SYSIDs
             that complete.
 
          3. G/O or "null" - report, close file, and exit.
 
          4. W/AIT [ D/ONE | P/RINT ] [ n ] - wait "n" seconds, then
                   report those SYSIDs that have changed status, go
                   back to sleep, etc. DONE specifies that waiting
                   will terminate when all SYSIDs have completed, and
                   is the default. PRINT specifies that waiting will
                   terminate when all SYSIDs have have completed
                   running, and are just printing, waiting to print,
                   or have been spilled. The DONE, PRINT, and "n"
                   options set global values, and need be specified
                   only once. Note that deferred jobs are never waited
                   for.
 
          5. S/LEEP [ D/ONE | P/RINT ] [ n ] - same as WAIT.
 
          6. C/ANCEL sysid - cancels the specified SYSID with
                     its output deleted. Remembers the SYSID
                     along with previous comment if no comment
                     was specified.
 
          7. ND/ELETE - Inhibits records of SYSIDs from being
                        deleted.
 
          8. !Ibex command - does M$YC with specified command.
             $Ibex command - just like !Ibex command.
 
          9. BATCH fid [ options ] - does M$YC with specified command
                   image, followed by automatic LAST command. The options
                   may be any of the options you would ordinarily specify
                   to IBEX. The comment to be remembered will be "fid",
                   or the last X, XX, 'X', or 'XX' substitution string
                   specified. The "T" option will inhibit the automatic
                   LAST command. The entire BATCH command image will be
                   passed to IBEX as specified.
 
         10. @ fid [ cmd ] - does M$LINK to specified "fid". If account
                   in "fid" is missing, then :SYS is assumed. The command
                   passed via the M$LINK is either "fid" or "cmd".
 
         11. @@ fid [ cmd ] - same as "@" command, except does M$LDTRC
                    instead of M$LINK.
 
         12. MI/NE or MY - Restricts reports to only those SYSIDs that
                    the currently logged on user of "A" has entered.
 
         13. AL/L - Resets MINE command so that all SYSIDs in the file
                    are reported.
 
         14. EV/ERY [ D/ONE | P/RINT ] [ n ] - Works just like WAIT &
                    SLEEP, except running jobs are always reported on
                    every "n" seconds.
 
         15. [ A/CCOUNT= ] . [ acct ] - Searches the input, output and
                    running queues for jobs in the specified account.
                    If found, the SYSIDs are entered as if you
                    entered them individually.  If the job has a jobname,
                    it is inserted as a comment as is the account if it
                    is not the LOGON account.  If 'acct' is omitted,
                    the LOGON account is assumed.
 
         16. DEL/ETE - Overrides NDELETE. Note that DELETE is the
                       default, and need not be specified.
 
     Anytime "A" reports, it deletes records of SYSIDs that have been
     completed. Whenever the file is closed (WAIT or GO commands), it
     will be deleted if it is empty, unless the $$JOB file has
     explicit access controls associated with it. You can create a
     $$JOB file with access controls by doing the following:
 
          !A.X(NDELETE
          !MOD $$JOB TO ( <attribute list> )
 
     For the purposes of "A", a SYSID may be specified as follows:
 
          1. Decimal number.
 
          2. N/AME=jobname.
 
          3. L/AST - use SYSID of last job batched.
 
          4. M/E - use my current SYSID. An informative comment will
                   be supplied if none is explicitly specified.
 
          5. Any of the above followed by a text-string for "A" to
             repeat back to you when it does a report.
             For NAME=jobname, the specified jobname always
             preceeds any comment specified.
 
     Commands may be input from M$SI (#2), or may be contained on the
     command line as processor options ( (...) ). GO is the default if
     SYSIDs only are specified as processor options.
 
     Multiple commands may be specified per record by separating
     commands with semi-colons ( ";" ). Note that each command is
     performed immediately as it encountered, therefore GO;WAIT is
     equivalent to GO.
 
     If users of "A" that are logged on as different user ids are
     allowed to update the same $$JOB file, then by default reports
     will be produced for SYSIDs that were entered by the currently
     logged on user only. This can be changed by using the ALL
     command. See also the MINE command.
