.UNL -4
ASM6502 is a cross-assembler for 6502 hardware.  It is written in FORTRAN
and a small amount of optional PL-6, so it should be transportable to
other systems with a minimum of conversion.  The following features
are supported:
 
.INL +4
.UNL +4
o   Labels must begin in column 1.  They may be of any length, but only
the first 8 characters are significant.  Labels may consist of
upper and lower case letters (A-Z, a-z), numerals (0-9), periods
(.), colons (:), and underscores (_).  The first character must not
be a numeral.  If the label is two or more characters and ends in
a colon (:), the colon is stripped; however, the colon must be
followed by a space to separate the label field from the opcode.
Up to 999 labels may be defined.  Examples:  ABC, Z29, A:X, X..y, _82d.
 
.UNL +4
o   Opcodes must be preceded by at least one space and may be any
length, but only the first 8 characters are significant.  Opcodes
may consist of upper and lower case letters (A-Z, a-z), numerals
(0-9), periods (.), colons (:), and underscores (_).  The first
character must not be a numeral.  The 56 operations in the 6502
instruction set are pre-defined and may not be redefined via macro
statements.  40 assembler directives are also supported; these may
not be redefined via macro statements.  Up to 104 additional opcodes
may be defined as macros by the user.
 
.UNL +4
o   Arguments must be preceded by at least one space and must follow
the opcode.  Arguments may not contain embedded spaces not enclosed
in text or constant strings.  Arguments are separated by commas, but
no spaces.  For more detail, see "Expressions" below.
 
.UNL +4
o   Comments may follow the arguments (if any).  If the opcode has no
arguments (such as TAX), comments must be preceded by a semicolon
(;) or exclamation mark (!).  If the opcode has arguments, comments
may be separated from the arguments by one or more spaces, a
semicolon, or an exclamation mark.  If the first non-blank character
on a line is a semicolon or exclamation mark, the entire line is a
comment.  If column one of the input line contains an asterisk (*),
the entire line is a comment.
 
.UNL +4
o   Input lines may be any length from one to 256 characters; however,
they may not be continued.

.*K* EXPRESSIONS
Expressions
-----------
.FIN
.ALB
 
 
.INL 0
.UNL -4
With exceptions noted in individual commands below, arguments may be
expressions of any complexity.  Expressions are made up of constants,
symbols (see the definition of labels above), and operations.
 
.INL +4
.UNL +4
o   Constants may be specified in decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal, split
octal, packed decimal, character, or text.  Constants may not exceed 16
bits in magnitude (0-65535 or -32768 to 32767).
 
.INL +4
.UNL +4
-   Decimal constants consist of one or more numeric digits (0-9)
optionally followed by a D.  Examples:  29, 0, 1257D.
 
.UNL +4
-   Binary constants consist of 0's and 1's either (a) preceded by
a percent sign(%), (b) followed by a B, or (c) enclosed in
single quotes (') and either preceded or followed by a B.
Examples:  %101, 01010B, B'1100', '00110011'B.
 
.UNL +4
-   Octal constants consist of numeric digits 0-7 either (a)
preceded by an at sign (@), (b) followed by a K, or (c)
enclosed in single quotes and either preceded or followed by
an O.  Examples:  @27, 762K, O'12063', '000'O.
 
.UNL +4
-   Split octal constants consist of numeric digits 0-7 followed
by an O (oh).  Counting from the right, each third digit must
be in the range 0-3.  Examples:  27O, 1122O, 377377O.
 
.UNL +4
-   Hexadecimal constants consist of numeric digits (0-9) and the
letters A-F either (a) preceded by a dollar sign ($), (b)
beginning with a numeric digit (0-9) and followed by an H, or
(c) enclosed in single quotes and either preceded or followed
by an X.  Examples:  $AB, 0AFH, X'27', '3A4'X.  Note that a
constant specified as A29H is a symbol; to specify the hex
constant A29 it is necessary to precede it by a leading zero
(0A29H).
 
.UNL +4
-   Packed constants consist of numeric digits (0-9) and the
letters A-F either (a) preceded by a dollar sign ($), (b)
beginning with a numeric digit (0-9) and followed by a P, or
(c) enclosed in single quotes and either preceded or followed
by a P.  Examples:  $013, 027CP, P'27', '2A4'P.  Note that a
constant specified as A29H is a symbol; to specify the packed
constant A29 it is necessary to precede it by a leading zero
(0A29H).  Note also that packed and hexadecimal constants are
synonymous.
 
.UNL +4
-   Character constants consist of one or two characters enclosed
in single or double quotes (' or ").  To specify a single quote
inside a single-quoted string, two successive single quotes
('') are used; similarly, a double quote in a double-quoted
string is specified by two successive double quotes ("").
Examples:  'HI', "a", '''', '"', """", "'".  Character constants
are treated as integers, right-justified with leading binary
zeros, if required.
 
.UNL +4
-   Text constants are character constants of three or more
characters.  Text constants may not be used in expressions,
but must be specified as the sole entry in an argument.
Examples:  "Hi, there", 'This is a text constant'.
 
.INL -4
.UNL +4
o   The following operations are allowed within expressions, listed in
order of precedence.  All intermediate results in expression
evaluation are truncated to 16 bits.
 
.INL +4
.UNL +4
-   Unary (prefix) plus (+) and minus (-).  These operators are
evaluated first in an expression.  Examples:  +1, -$A,
--+XYZ.  Note that multiple prefix operators may precede a
constant, symbol, or sub-expression.
 
.UNL +4
-   Multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (\).  Division
is performed with integers (i.e., any remainder is discarded).
A\B is defined as A-B*(A/B).  Division or modulus by zero is
illegal.
 
.UNL +4
-   Addition (+) and subtraction (-).
 
.UNL +4
-   Shift right (>>) and shift left (<<).  Logical shifts are
performed (i.e., the sign bit is not preserved).  Shifts of 16
bits or greater will give zero as a result.  Examples:  10>>1
(=5), $CA<<4 (=$CA0), '27'O<<16 (=0).
 
.UNL +4
-   Logical not (~).  This is a prefix operator, and may be
compounded.  Examples:  ~A, ~'1'B, ~~27H.  The not operator
inverts all 16 bits in a value.
 
.UNL +4
-   Logical AND (&).  0&0=0, 0&1=0, 1&0=0, 1&1=1.
 
.UNL +4
-   Logical inclusive OR (|) and exclusive OR (||).  0|0=0, 0|1=1,
1|0=1, 1|1=1.  0||0=0, 0||1=1, 1||0=1, 1||1=0.
 
.UNL +4
-   Relations:  Less than (<), Less than or equal to (<=), equal to
(=), not equal to (~= or <>), greater than (>), and greater than
or equal to (>=).  The result of any of these comparisons is
either 0 (false) or -1 ($FFFF, true).
 
.INL -4
Expressions are evaluated in accordance with the rules of precedence
listed above; operations of equal precedence are executed left to
right.  The programmer may force evaluation of a sub-expression by
placing it within brackets ([]).  Parentheses may not be used to
bracket sub-expressions since they are used to denote operand type.
 
.UNL +4
o   The symbol $ or * may be used to reference the current location
counter and therefore must not be defined by the programmer as a
label.  Additionally, the following identifiers are used to
represent the registers and must not be defined by the programmer
as labels:  A, X, and Y.

.*K* ARGUMENT_FORMATS
Argument Formats
-------- -------
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL -4
The following 13 argument formats are recognized by ASM6502 on machine
instructions:
 
.INL +4
.UNL +4
o   Implied addressing.  No argument field is present.  Example:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    TAX
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL +4
o   Immediate operand.  The argument field is limited to 8 bits in
magnitude and must be preceded by a pound sign (#) or equals sign
(=).  Example:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    ADC #27
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL +4
o   Indirect, pre-indexed by X.  The entire argument field is enclosed
in a single set of parentheses and contains an 8-bit displacement
followed by ",X".  Example:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    CMP (PGZRO,X)
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL +4
o   Indirect, post-indexed by Y.  The first argument is enclosed in a
single set of parentheses and contains an 8-bit displacement; the
second argument is ",Y".  Example:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    STA (HERE+$16),Y
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL +4
o   Indirect.  The argument is enclosed in a single set of parentheses
and contains a 16-bit address.  Example:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    JMP (FAR_AWAY)
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL +4
o   A-register.  The argument is simply "A".  Example:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    ROL A
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL +4
o   Indexed by X.  Two forms are recognized, depending on whether the
argument field reduces to a page zero address (8 bits) or larger
(16 bits).  Examples:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    LDY $27,X
    INC HERE+'100'X,X
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL +4
o   Indexed by Y.  Two forms are recognized, depending on whether the
argument field reduces to a page zero address (8 bits) or larger
(16 bits).  Examples:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    STX '14'O,Y
    LDX TABLE+512,Y
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL +4
o   Direct address.  Three forms are recognized, depending on whether
the argument field reduces to a page zero address (8 bits) or
larger (16 bits), or the operation code is a branch instruction.
In the latter case the argument must reduce to a value such that
-128 <= value - location counter - 2 <= 127.  Examples:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    BIT '10110'B
    CPY LIMITS+X'2700'
    BCC *+3

Note:  When assembling branch instructions, the assembler computes
the value of the argument expression, then subtracts the current
value of the location counter plus two from it.  The result must be
representable in 7 bits, plus sign (-128 to 127), and it may not
be relocatable or external.

.*K* ASSEMBLER_DIRECTIVES
Assembler Directives
--------- ----------
.SPB 1
.FIN
.ALC
.UNL -4
The following assembler directives are recognized by ASM6502:
 
.FIN
.ALB
.INL +4
.UNL +4
o   Define data constants:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    [label] DATA {expr|text}[,{expr|text}]...
    [label] TEXT {text|expr}[,{text|expr}]...
    [label] DEFM {text|expr}[,{text|expr}]...
 
.FIN
.ALB
Expressions are reduced to 8 or 16-bit values and stored at the
current value of the location counter.  Note that 16-bit values
are stored most significant byte first, the reverse of normal
6502 addresses.  Text constants are stored in ASCII.  If a label
is present, it is assigned the value of the location counter
before storing the first byte.  Numeric expressions may not be relocatable.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define 16-bit constants:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    [label] WORD expr[,expr]...
 
.FIN
.ALB
Expressions are reduced to 16-bit values and stored at the current
value of the location counter.  Note that the values are stored
most significant byte first, the reverse of normal 6502 addresses.
If a label is present, it is assigned the value of the location
counter before storing the first byte.  "expr" may not be
relocatable.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define 8-bit constants:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    [label] BYTE expr[,expr]...
    [label] DEFB expr[,expr]...
 
.FIN
.ALB
Expressions are reduced to 8-bit values and stored at the current
value of the location counter.  If a label is present, it is
assigned the value of the location counter before storing the
first byte.  Expressions may be relocatable.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define address constants:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    [label] ADDR expr[,expr]...
    [label] DEFW expr[,expr]...
 
.FIN
.ALB
Expressions are reduced to 16-bit values and stored at the current
value of the location counter, least significant byte first.  If a
label is present, it is assigned the value of the location counter
before storing the first byte.  Expressions may be relocatable.
 
.UNL +4
o   Equate:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    label   EQU expr
    label   = expr
 
.FIN
.ALB
A label is required.  The value of the label is set to the value
of the expression.
No code is generated; the location
counter is not affected.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define value:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    label   SET expr
 
.FIN
.ALB
A label is required.  The value of the label is set to the value
of the expression.
No code is generated; the location
counter is not affected.  SET differs from EQU in that multiple
assignments may be made to the same label; only the latest one is
retained.  The format "label SET $" may be used as an effective
"no-op" to define a label for a GOTO command (see below).
 
.UNL +4
o   Define origin:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    [label] ORG expr
 
.FIN
.ALB
The location counter is set to the value of the expression.
No
code is generated.  If a label is present, it is assigned the value
of the expression.
 
.UNL +4
o   Advance location counter to a boundary:
 
    [label] BOUND expr
 
.FIN
.ALB
The location counter is advanced to the next multiple of the expression.
The expression must be positive and non-zero.  No code is generated in
the skipped bytes (if any).  If a label is present, it is assigned the
value of the location counter after it is advanced.
 
.UNL +4
o   Reserve memory:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    [label] DEFS expr
    [label] BSS expr
    [label] RES expr
 
.FIN
.ALB
The expression is evaluated and the location counter is advanced
by "expr" bytes.  No code is generated in the skipped bytes.
If
a label is present, it is assigned the value of the location
counter before it is advanced.  "expr" is treated as an unsigned
value, 0-65535.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define global symbol:
 
.FIF
.ALL
            ENT label[,label]...
            DEF label[,label]...
 
.FIN
.ALB
No label is allowed.  Each of the labels listed in the argument
field is defined as a symbol that can be referenced from outside
this program unit.  No code is generated; the location counter is
not affected.  Each of the labels must appear in the label field of a
statement elsewhere in the program.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define external symbol:

No label is allowed.  Each of the labels listed in the argument
field is defined as a symbol which is not contained within this
program unit; references to these symbols will be resolved at
link time from modules which have defined them as ENT or
DEF operands.  No code is generated; the location counter is not
affected.  EXT, EXTL, REF, and REFL specify that the external
symbol is not on page zero (i.e., it is a "long" address); EXTS
and REFS specify that the external symbol is on page zero (i.e.,
it is a "short" address).  Up to 126 EXT/REF symbols may be
defined.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define program end:
 
.FIF
.ALL
            END [label]
 
.FIN
.ALB
No label is allowed.  The END statement marks the physical end of
the program deck.  If a label is present in the argument field,
it defines the entry point for this program and marks the program
as the main program.  An END statement is required at the end of
the input file.  It may not be present in include files or macro
expansions.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define listing title:
 
.FIF
.ALL
            NAME text
            TITLE text
 
.FIN
.ALB
No label is allowed.  The text (up to 80 characters) is placed in
the listing at the top of each page.  An immediate
page break is also performed.  No code is generated; the location
counter is not affected.  This command is not listed on the listing
unless LIST 8 is specified.
 
.UNL +4
o   Perform a page break:
 
.FIF
.ALL
            PAGE
            EJECT
 
.FIN
.ALB
No label or argument is allowed.  The listing is advanced to a new

This command is not listed on the listing unless LIST 8 is specified.
 
.UNL +4

.FIF
.ALL
            SKIP [expr]
            SPACE [expr]
 
.FIN
.ALB
No label is allowed.  The expression (if any) is evaluated and the
listing is advanced by (expr mod 64) lines.  If the expression is
omitted, 1 is assumed.  No code is generated; the location counter
is not affected.  This command is not listed on the listing unless
LIST 8 is specified.
 
.UNL +4
o   Include code from a file:
 
.FIF
.ALL
            INCL label
 
.FIN
.ALB
No label is allowed.  The file specified by "label" is inserted
unchanged into the program at this point.  Note that "label" is
limited by the rules of label formation, which may be a subset or
superset of the file names allowed by the host operating system.
INCL statements may not be nested; that is, an INCL file may not
contain an INCL command.

.FIN
.ALB
The expression in the argument field is evaluated.  If it is not
zero, the statements following the IF statement are assembled until
an ELSE or FI statement is encountered.  If
the expression is zero, the statements following it are skipped
until an ELSE or FI statement is encountered.  If the expression
is not zero and an ELSE statement is encountered, statements
following it are skipped until a FI statement is encountered; if
the expression is zero and an ELSE statement is encountered,
statements following it are assembled.  Examples:
 
.FIF
.ALL
        IF     0
        <stmt 1>                       (skipped)
        <stmt 2>                       (skipped)
        ELSE
        <stmt 3>                       (assembled)
        <stmt 4>                       (assembled)
        FI
 
        IF     1
        <stmt 1>                       (assembled)
        <stmt 2>                       (assembled)
        ELSE
        <stmt 3>                       (skipped)
        <stmt 4>                       (skipped)
        FI
 
.FIN
.ALB
IF[/ELSE]/FI must occur in matched groups; an ELSE statement applies
to the last unmatched IF statement encountered; a FI statement
applies to the last unmatched ELSE or IF statement encountered.  IF
commands may be nested to any level.  Labels, if present, may be
used as targets for GOTO statements (see below), and are not entered
into the symbol table.
 
.UNL +4
o   Skip statements unconditionally:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    [label] GOTO label
 
.FIN
.ALB
All statements are skipped until the label specified in the
argument field is encountered.  Skipping may occur only in the
forward direction.  The label may not occur within an INCL file,
if the INCL directive follows the GOTO statement, since the INCL
will not be executed.  If a statement label is present, it may be
used as a target for a prior GOTO statement, but is not entered into
the symbol table.
 
.UNL +4
o   Turn listing of statements on or off:
 
.FIF
.ALL
            LIST [expr]
 
.FIN
.ALB
No label is allowed.  The expression (if any) is evaluated and used
as follows:
 
.FIF
.ALL
        1 - Normal listing of source commands only
        2 - List include files
        4 - List macro expansions
        8 - List all assembler directives
 
.FIN
.ALB
If the expression is omitted, 1 is assumed; if it exceeds 15, it
is used modulo 16.  Listing options may be summed to specify the
type of listing desired.  For example, LIST 5 provides a listing
of macro expansions and source commands, but not include files or
assembler directives not normally listed (TITLE, SPACE, etc.).
LIST 0 turns the listing off entirely and is equivalent to NLIST.
 
.UNL +4
o   Turn listing off:
 
.FIF
.ALL
            NLIST
 
.FIN
.ALB
NLIST is equivalent to LIST 0 (see above).  No label or argument is
allowed.
 
.UNL +4
o   Define macro:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    label   MAC [dummy[,dummy]...]
            ...
            MEND
 
.FIN
.ALB
A label is required and is entered into the table of allowed
operation codes flagged as a macro.  Statements following the
MAC command up to the next MEND command are copied to the macro
file for use later.  A macro may not define a macro; that is, MAC
commands may not be nested.  No code is generated for a macro
until it is invoked.  The dummies specify symbols corresponding to
user-supplied expressions on an invocation line; they are positional
in nature (that is, dummy symbol 1 corresponds to user argument 1 on
the macro invocation line).  Example:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    SAVE MAC B1,B2                     <Macro definition>
         LDA  B1
         STA  B2
         MEND
 
    HI   SAVE VALUE+10,TABLE-9         <Macro invocation>
 
.FIN
.ALB
The macro "SAVE" is defined on the first four lines.  The dummies
B1 and B2 correspond to the two user-supplied arguments.  No code
is generated for the LDA/STA sequence, since this is the macro
definition phase.  The last line shows the invocation of the
macro.  "VALUE+10" is used in the macro expansion as "B1" and
"TABLE-9" in place of "B2".  The expanded code looks like this:
 
.FIF
.ALL
    HI    LDA  VALUE+10
          STA  TABLE-9
 
.FIN
.ALB
If a macro invocation statement is labeled, the label is given the
value of the current location counter.  Since the macro expander
works by substituting the text of the arguments in place of the
dummies, care must be taken that the expanded text within the macro
does not exceed 256 characters per line.  Up to 104 macros may be
defined by the user.  All macros must be defined before any is
invoked, and they may be nested up to 9 levels.  Macros may be
recursive.  Macros may not contain INCL statements.
 
.UNL +4
o   Change options:
 
.FIF
.ALL
            OPTS option[,option]...
 
.FIN
.ALB
No label is allowed.  The options listed are merged into the current
options (see below for a listing of options).  Some options must
have been turned on at program invocation time, such as XR and OU;
these may be turned off and back on in the program.  However, they
may not be turned on if the program was invoked without them.  See
below for details.

default.  NLS/LS may be specified by an OPTS command any time.
 
.UNL +4
o   [N]OU - Produce an object program via "object" DCB (F$107).  OU is
the default.  OU must be specified at invocation time, but may
be turned off and on.
 
.UNL +4
o   [N]XR[EF] - Produce a cross-reference of all symbols on the
listing DCB (F$106).  NXR is the default.  XR must be specified
at invocation time, but may be turned off and on.
 
.UNL +4
o   AB[S] or RE[L] - Produce an absolute (ABS) or relocatable (REL)
object unit.  ABS is the default.  Either may appear on an
OPTS command, but caution is advised.
 
.UNL +4
o   SR[CH](.acct[,.acct]...) - Specifies accounts to search for files
specified on INCL commands.  The running account is always
searched first.  Up to eight accounts may be specified, to be
searched in the order given.  If specified on an OPTS command,
the accounts will entirely replace any previous entries.
 
.UNL +4
o   Cn - Specifies the target machine's clock speed in megahertz.  "n"
may range from 1 (1 megahertz) to 4 (4 megahertz), for use in
timing computations.  If omitted, a one megahertz clock is
assumed.  This option instructs the assembler to print timing
information at the right margin of the listing; this is done
only if the listing device width is 81 columns or greater.
Cn may be changed via OPTS any time.  See CLOCK below.
 
.UNL +4
o   CL[OCK]=real - Specifies the clock frequency as a real number of
megahertz.  This form may be used in place of the Cn option
above if the clock is not an integral multiple of megahertz.
Only two fractional digits are retained, though more may be
specified.  CLOCK may be changed via OPTS any time.
 
.UNL +4
o   HE[X] or OC[TAL] - Specifies the format to be used to display
addresses and generated code or data on the listing.  If HEX
is specified, addresses appear as four hex digits followed by
up to sixteen hex digits of generated code.  If OCTAL is
specified, addresses appear as six hex digits followed by up
to twelve octal digits of generated code.  HEX is the default.
HEX or OCTAL may be changed via OPTS any time.  See AO below.
 
.UNL +4
o   [N]AO - Specifies that the assembler address field on the listing
is to be expressed in split octal format.  AO is only effective
if OCTAL has been specified.  NAO specifies normal octal format
for the address field and is the default when OCTAL is specified.
AO may be changed via OPTS any time.
 
.UNL +4
o   Px - Specifies the parity to be applied to generated text values.
"x" may be one of the following:
 
.FIF
.ALL
        0 or S or N - No parity (parity bit is zero).
        1 or E - Even parity.

O - Opcode error.  Unknown, missing, or malformed.
 
.UNL +4
P - Pass synchronization error; a label does not have the same
value on pass 2 as it did on pass 1.  This is probably due
to macro expansions or IFs that use forward references.
 
.UNL +4
R - Relocation error; an argument field cannot be relocated.
 
.UNL +4
S - Syntactical error, usually in an argument expression.

successive lines are used.  In OCTAL mode, only 4 bytes are
printed per line.
 
.UNL +4
t - Contains an X if the value is external to the program or an R
if the address field is relocatable.  Otherwise, it is blank.
 
.UNL +4
nnnn - Contains the sequential line number of the source input
statement.  Numbering is restarted at 1 for each INCL file.
 
.UNL +4
f - Contains a blank if the input statement came from the user's
source file, a plus sign (+) if the statement is part of an
expanded macro statement, an asterisk (*) if the statement is
being skipped, and a hyphen (-) if the statement comes from an
INCL file.
 
.UNL +4
sss... - Contains the source statement.  If the output device platen
width is 72 or less, only 39 characters are printed and the
"ccc" field is omitted; if it is 73-80, 47 characters are
printed and the "ccc" field is omitted; if it is 81 or greater,
76 characters are printed along with the "ccc" field.
 
.UNL +4
ccc... - If the output device width is sufficiently large, timing
information is printed in columns 110-132.  Times are printed

.FIF
.ALL
    :aabbbbcc[dd]...ee[<CR>][<LF>]
 
.FIN
.ALB
.UNL -4
Each record begins with a colon (:) as a resync character.  Pairs
of characters follow, in "printable hex"; that is, the internal
hexadecimal representation of the byte is converted to two printable
characters, 0-9 and A-F, in the host's character set.  Up to 78
characters (representing 39 bytes) may follow the colon character;
each record may be followed by carriage return (CR), line feed (LF),
or both, dependent on the host.  Each record is divided into five
fields, indicated above.  Record types may be written to the file
in any order and may be intermixed.
 
.INL +8
.UNL +4
aa - is the count of the number of dd bytes (not characters) in
the record, 0 to 34 (00 to 22 hex).
 
.UNL +4
bbbb - is normally used as an address field, MSB first (reverse of
normal 6502 address format).
 
.UNL +4
cc - contains the record type or command (see below).
 
.UNL +4
dd[dd]... - are data bytes, depending on the
record type.
 
.UNL +4
ee - is a checksum, defined as the arithmetic inverse of the sum of
all the bytes in the record, modulo 256.  To verify the
checksum, sum the hexadecimal (internal) values of all the
fields, aa through dd, then add to the checksum, ee.  The
result should be zero, modulo 256.
 
.INL 0
The record types are defined as follows:
 
.INL +8
.UNL +4
cc = 00 or 10 - Load data
 
The dd data bytes are to be loaded, starting at bbbb for aa
bytes.  If cc=10, these data are in a relocatable section.
 
.UNL +4
cc = 01 - Define entry
 
bbbb defines the entry point for the program.  aa is zero,
and there are no dd bytes.
 
.UNL +4
cc = 02 or 12 - Advance to boundary
 
bbbb is the "old" value of the location counter which is to be
advanced to a multiple of dddd.  The linker may use the two values
to determine the value to be added to the current location counter
to advance to the new boundary.  All 00, 03, 04, 05, 10, and 15
data generated prior to the BOUND command have already been written
to the OU file.  cc=12 specifies a relocatable section.
 
.UNL +4
cc = 03 - Relocate long
 
bbbb is not used.  aa must be a multiple of three.  The dd
field is divided into 3-byte commands:
 
.UNL -4
    mmmmxx
 
mmmm defines the left-most (LSB in normal 6502 addressing)
byte of a 2-byte address which must be relocated.  xx defines
the relocation base (0-127) and whether the base is to be
added (+0) or subtracted (+128) from (mmmm).  Relocation base
zero is page zero; relocation base 1 is non-page zero memory.
Relocation bases 2-127 are externally-referenced symbols, which
will be defined by external reference definition records (see
below).
 
.UNL +4
cc = 04 - Relocate short
 
These records are formatted exactly as 03-type records, except
that the mmmm fields address single-byte address fields.
 
.UNL +4
cc = 05 or 15 - Reserve memory
 
aa contains 02.  dddd bytes of memory are to be reserved for
non-initialized data beginning at bbbb.  dddd is expressed as
an unsigned integer, MSB first.  cc=15 specifies relocatability.
 
.UNL +4
cc = 80 - Define symbol
 
aa contains 09.  Eight dd bytes are the host's internal
representation of a symbol, expressed in hexadecimal.  The 9th
byte is the assembler's flag byte:  16=relocatable symbol,
8=EXT/REF, 4=ENT/DEF, 2=SET, 1=defined symbol.  bbbb is
the unrelocated value of the symbol, as defined on the last
assembler pass.  Type 80 records are only present if schema was
requested at assembly time.
 
.UNL +4
cc = 81 - Entry or symbol definition
 
This record is formatted exactly the same as the type 80 record.
One type 81 record will be written for every ENT or DEF symbol
defined in the program.
 
.UNL +4
cc = 82 - External reference
 
aa and dd are formatted exactly the same as the type 80 record.
bbbb contains (right-justified) the relocation base number that
was assigned by the assembler, range 2-127 (0002 to 007F hex).

Two major problems exist in the current implementation:
.SPB 1
The relocatable code option has not been thoroughly tested, and there
are instances when relocation information is not written out when it
should be.  Since there is no linker for the assembler, users are
advised to refrain from using the REL option.
.SPB 1
The intent of making the assembler do three passes on the source
program was to correctly resolve page-zero addresses properly.  Unfortunately,
this does not work in all cases.  To avoid spurious "D" (double-definition)
error messages, users are advised to place all definitions of symbols
for page zero prior to instructions that reference them.
