X28 emulates an X.28 PAD to provide remote host access to users with CL
resource authorization.
To use the X28 PAD emulator, you must be authorized to use CL (communication
line) resources.  Your system should also, of course, be connected in the
proper fashion to someone who can accept remote access.
 
To enter the X28 PAD emulator, simply type:
    !X28.X
 
Once entered, X28 can accept individual commands:
 
 
 Command         Alt. Abbrev.   Meaning
 CON/NECT addr [<,opt>]         Starts a virtual circuit & engages data mode

6/2/92 - PAR - Fixed local LF insertion (13=4).
               Fixed to ignore remote attempt to disable PAD recall.
5/17/91 - PAR - fixed local edit to ignore idle timer.
2/18/91 - PAR - reset breakcount on breaks, now that they work properly.
1/28/91 - PAR - fixed star 40655 - traps for empty input packets.
10/22/90 - PAR.  Made compatible with XELA.X
10/10/90 - PAR fixed stars 39417 and 38462.
The alias file is now named :X28ADR, and can have up to 8 character aliases.
However, it is compatible with old :NETADR files - just rename your :NETADR
file to :X28ADR.  Or, put it in :SYS or :SYSTAC, and everyone will be using it
by default.

options can be specified in any order, separated by commas. Options include
            reverse charging (R), fast select (FS), call user data (D),
            and the resource name to use (@):

DEF/INE alias = address description
Parameters:
alias       specifies the alias for address - up to 8 alphanumeric characters.
address     specifies the (upto) 14 digit network address of the remote host.
description textual description of the address (such as site, host ...).
            If the first character of description is '@', the adjoining word
            is taken to mean a resourcename to be used to call this address.
            (See the RNAME command).  If DEFAULT is defined as an alias, its
            description is used to set the default for RNAME.
Description:

command) for use with the CON command. Long addresses can be represented by
familiar names.
