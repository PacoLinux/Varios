INSREC is a tool to help with integrations.  It takes a new
version of a file (e.g. F_ERRORS_C) and inserts it into
another file (e.g. B_ERRORS_C) replacing the old version and
leaving the rest of the file untouched.
 
.*B*
The replacement file must have a /*M* as its first record.
The file that is to be partially replaced must have a /*M*
as the first record of each segment.  INSREC will replace
from the first matching /*M* up to the next /*M*.
 
!INSREC.X relacement-file OVER new-file,.oldacct
  replacement-file is the file containing one piece to be
    replaced.
  new-file is the new file to be created
  .oldacct is the account in which to find the current copy
    of new-file (only needed if different from new-file).
 
Example:
 
!INSREC.X F_ERRORS_C.:B00TOU OVER B_ERRORS_C.:B00TOU,.:B00OU
 
Find an existing copy of B_ERRORS_C in .:B00TOU, or if not
there then in .:B00OU.  If B_ERRORS_C is busy, wait and try
again.  Copy B_ERRORS_C from the existing copy to .:B00TOU
replacing the F_ERRORS_C part with F_ERRORS_C.:B00TOU.
