FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
MODEST  (MOdular Disk Extended STatus tool) takes an extended status from a
Modular Disk Subsystem as input, and breaks it down into English for you.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!MODEST.X
 
.*B*
MODEST displays a menu of choices.  The main purpose, though, is to take an
extended status (in hex) from the user, decode it, and give an English
breakdown of the error back to the user.
.*B*
MODEST has a basic set of five actions:
 
   1) IPC-IPI Extended Status Interpretation
   2) IPI-3 Response Packet Interpretation
   3) Parameter ID and Octets Interpretation
   4) Rev number and Date for MODEST
   5) Exit MODEST.  (or E,X,Q)
 
.*B*
 
Still need more help?  #1 is what MODEST is all about.  You enter an extended
status, in hex, with a blank, comma, or semicolon separating the words.  (eg.
01 02 03 ...)  MODEST will proceed to decode the value, and give you the
English translation.
.*B*
 
#2 is used to break down the first nine words of the extended status (0-8).
This report is not quite as detailed as #1, and you don't have to type in all
those &#$%@! numbers either.
.*B*
 
#3 is related to #2, in that it decodes the latter words of the extended status
(9-35).  These are handy if you need to look at something again, you don't need
to type the entire 36 words back in!
.*B*
 
#4 is a revision level and last modified date of MODEST.  This information is
also available in the CHANGES topic of help.
.*B*
 
#5 is self-explanatory... it quits the program.
 
.*K* COMMANDS CHOICES
MODEST offers a full 5 commands from which to choose.
 
   1) IPC-IPI Extended Status Interpretation
   2) IPI-3 Response Packet Interpretation
   3) Parameter ID and Octets Interpretation
   4) Rev number and Date for MODEST
   5) Exit MODEST.  (or E,X,Q)

clarity by renaming variables, adding defines, and better function names.
