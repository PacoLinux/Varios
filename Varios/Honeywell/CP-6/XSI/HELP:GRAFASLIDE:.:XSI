GRAFASLIDE uses CP-6 DIGS to generate slides and viewgraphs.  It is primarily
designed to produce output for the QMS1200 laserprinter at LADC.
Invocation syntax:
 
!GRAFASLIDE.X source_file OVER output_file,lo_file (opts)
 
opts are:
 
BORDER    means put a blank border around the slide (about 10%).
 
FRAME     means draw a line around the frame (see %FRAME command)
 
35MM      means make the aspect ratio the same as 35MM film.
 
TV        means make the slide have a 2.5" border all around, for videotape
 
ROTATE    means "flip the X and Y axes".  Useful if you're using a device
          whose Y axis is longer than its X axis.
 
source_file is a specially prepared file of the text to be placed on the slides
(DCB is F$10).
 
output_file is the filename or device name of the destination graphics file or
device.  (DCB is GRAPHICS00)
 
lo_file is the filename or device name of the "LO" from GRAFASLIDE (DCB is
F$108).
 
Example:
 
!GRAFASLIDE.X somefile OVER SAVEVG
 
     puts the laserprinter-specific commands into a file called SAVEVG.
 
 
[However, at LADC, it is probably best to put your GRAFASLIDE input into a
file, and
 
!BATCH $SLIDEJOB.DEMO X=filename
 
this JCL is always kept up to date and takes care of "little problems" that
have been known to crop up.]
 
Also, at LADC, GRAFASLIDEDEC.X can be used for DEC ReGIS devices and
GRAFASLIDETEK.X can be used for TEK4010-compatible devices.  GRAFASLIDEDMP.X
can be used on the B for getting output on the plotter.  GRAFASLIDEDIG.X
produces DIGIS files using DCB GRAPHICS01, but still uses the command line #3
DCB.
Imbedded in the text input, there may be some special "control commands".
These special commands all begin with the percent sign in column 1, and must
have only single spaces embedded in them.
 
%FONT n
     means change the current font to be font n. (A list of available fonts is
available on the graphics board.  Font 13 is very popular.)
 
%SIZE s
     sets the size of characters to be displayed. Legal values for "s" are: S
(for small), M (for medium) and L (for large).
 
%PAGE
     means begin a new page
 
%LAYOUT V
     means that the page is to be laid out 8 1/2" by 11"
 
%LAYOUT H
     means that the page is to be laid out 11" by 8 1/2"
%LOGO xx [file]
     The LOGO command places a logo (.65" high X .55" wide) in any corner of
the page.  xx can be UR (upper-right), LR (lower-right), LL (lower-left) or UL
(upper-left).  By default, a filled CP-6 logo is generated.  However, if the
optional [file] is specified, that file is treated as SGL data (see the PICTURE
command), and the miniature %PICTURE will be placed as the logo.  Sample
commands:
 
%LOGO LR
%LOGO UR P:TIELOGO.DEMO
 
%NINDENT
%INDENT
     Turns the automatic indentation feature on or off.  Automatic indentation
is turned ON every new frame.  See HELP (GRAFASLIDE.X) INDENTATION for more
info.
 
%NOTE text_string
     Takes the text_string (maximum of 20 characters), right justifies it, and
places it at the lower-right edge of the viewgraph in Small Font 13 (and leaves
room for a logo).
 
%LASTLINE text_string
     Takes the text_string (maximum of 45 characters), and places it, centered,
on the very last line on the page, using the NOTE font (13) and using the
current SMALL size.   (If LAYOUT is V, the "lastline" will be slightly offset
to the left to leave room for a NOTE).
%BACKUP [n]
     "Backs up" the specified number of lines, using the current size
designator.  Default is 1 line.  This command can be used to produce
underscoring or multiple columns.  See HELP (GRAFASLIDE.X) COLUMNS for more
info.
 
%PICTURE fid LL=x1,y1 UR=x2,y2 FRAME={Y|N}
     Includes the specified file as a "move-draw" file and places it on the
page within the specified "lower left" and "upper right" window.  FRAME
specifies that the picture is to be shrunk 10% and have frame drawn around it.
See HELP (GRAFASLIDE.X) PICTURES for more info.
 
%FRAME
     Forces the drawing of a visible frame around the current active area of
the viewgraph.  This can be handy when previewing on a CRT device that has
different aspect ratio or physical characteristics than the plotter.  It is not
recommended that this option be used for final runs on hard-copy devices.
 
%*
     Indicates a commentary line to GRAFASLIDE.  This item and any text on the
line are ignored.
 
%CHARSIZES n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6
     CHARSIZES changes the default sizes of S,M, and L characters.  n1 is the
width (in inches) of the L characters, n2 is the height (in inches) of L
characters, n3 is width of M characters, n4 is height of M characters, n5 is
width of S characters, and n6 is height of S characters. Defaults are:
%CHARSIZES .30,.40,.21,.28,.15,.20
 
%CHARSPACE n
     CHARSPACE changes the inter-character spacing, which can be useful for the
monospaced fonts.  %CHARSPACE -.1 means put the characters 10% closer together.
%CHARSPACE .2 means put the characters 20% farther apart.
 
%ALL
%ALC
     These commands ALign Centered, or ALign Left, just like their TEXT
equivalents.  No, there isn't an ALign Both, or an ALign Right.
The maximum plotting area of the QMS1200 is about 8.4 x 10.8 inches.  You can
create a border around the viewgraphs by unsing the BORDER command line option.
The program just starts at the upper left-hand corner and starts putting text
out.  (That means if you want space at the top of a viewgraph, you have to put
a blank line in the input file.  If you want space at the left, you should
indent your lines.)
 
The characters come in three sizes, SMALL, MEDIUM, and LARGE.
 
LARGE characters are .3 inches wide, and .4 inches apart vertically.
     (33 LARGE characters will fit across a 10" page.)
     (23 LARGE characters will fit across a 7"  page.)
 
MEDIUM characters are .21 inches wide and .28 inches apart vertically.
     (47 MEDIUM characters will fit across a 10" page.)
     (33 MEDIUM characters will fit across a 7"  page.)
 
SMALL characters are .15 inches wide and .20 inches apart vertically.
     (66 SMALL characters will fit across a 10" page.)
     (46 SMALL characters will fit across a 7"  page.)
 
[The above-specified values are for monospaced fonts; use of proportionally
spaced fonts can result in up to 50% more characters per line.]

Default character sizes:
 
SIZE LARGE = .3 inches wide, .4 inches high
 
SIZE MEDIUM = .21 inches wide, .28 inches high
 
SIZE SMALL = .15 inches wide, .20 inches high
 
This corresponds to a CHARSIZE command of:
 
%CHARSIZES .30,.40,.21,.28,.15,.20
Columnar output is usually cumbersome, but can be accomplished with one of two
techniques:
 
1)   Use of monospaced fonts.  The monospaced fonts can be handily used to
produce almost exact facsimiles of what you saw on your terminal screen, but
they aren't as attractive as using proportional fonts.  If things still don't
line up, try using %NINDENT.  Use of monospaced fonts is probably best when
"line-printer" images or CRT screen facsimiles are desired.
2)   Use of the %BACKUP command may be useful if multiple columns of
proportional-font items are desired.  For example:
 
%FONT 13
%SIZE S
     o This is the
     o data for column
     o one of the chart
     o and drones on and
     o on......
%BACKUP 5
                    o until it reaches
                    o this column, at
                    o which time the
                    o %INDENT action
                    o takes over.
CHANGES
For an example of an input file, see GRAFASLIDE_ID.X.  Note that you can mix
layout modes in an input file.
Experiments with the program showed that indenting small-character lines under
large-character lines didn't give the expected results, because the "space" of
the smaller character set isn't as big as tne "space" in the large character
set.  As a result, the any line with leading spaces is indented the same amount
on the page as if it had large-font "spaces" in front of it.  However, this
reduces the maximum number of characters that can be placed on a line with
preceeding spaces.  If you wish to disable this feature (which is activated
automatically every new frame), use the %NINDENT directive.
Error checking in the program is minimal.  If you request a size that's not
SMALL, MEDIUM or LARGE, it will be ignored.  If you request a font that's not
numeric FORTRAN DECODE will probably print nasty messages on your terminal.  If
it's not in the range of known fonts, something funny will probably happen.

The %PICTURE directive can be used to include a "move-draw" file.  To get the
best results from move-draw inclusion, you must be a bit more familiar with
page layout dimensions.
 
If you use %LAYOUT H (the default), the page is 10" wide (10.65 for 35MM
option) and 7" high.  The coordinate system origin is in the lower-left hand
corner of the page.

PICTUREs use a special file format called  SGL that is used in CAP.  The CAP
manuals describe this format.
 
PICTUREs are automatically sized and centered in the window specified.  The TV
option (which creates output 4.2" by 6" centered on the page) really goofs up
the "PICTURE" directive, as the viewing area runs from 4.0 inches to 10.0
inches in the X direction, and from 0.0 inches to 4.2 inches in the Y
direction.  If you are using the TV option, you'll have to adjust the
dimensions of your PICTURE frame accordingly.
