XG$BUILD_FONT is used to build a :FONT file for use by the CP6 graphics
library.
XG$BUILD_FONT is invoked as:
 
!XG$BUILD_FONT.X sifile OVER oufile [(options)]
 
Fonts are defined using a coordinate system where the coordinates are integers
in the range of -255 to 255.  The lower left hand corner of the character is at
0,0.  Normal characters will fit inside a box of 100 by 100.  Characters with
decenders, such as lower case "g" may extend to Y=-21 and still maintain a
"normal" appearence.
 
The entire font description must be present to order to build a font file.  The
resulting file may be copied into :FONT for use by the graphics library.
 
A font name is defined by a command in the form:
%fontname=number
 
This command associates a font name with a font number, since all fonts are
referred to by numbers in the graphics library.  This command must appear
before any characters descriptions.  The font name must be between 1 and 10
characters long.  The font number must be between 1 and 99999.  The first 10000
fonts are reserved for CP6.  This may be over-ridden by a command line option
of "O[VERRIDE]".
 
Character descriptions are in a fixed format.  The first 10 characters must be
the font name.  The eleventh character must be the ASCII representation of the
character described.  Coordinate pairs begin in column 14.  The first
coordinate pair is actually the width of the character.  The first coordinate
is ignored, and the second number is the actual width of the character.  When
setting the width, and coordinates, allowances for spacing to the left and
right of the character should be made.  Coordinate pairs are of the form: "nnnn
nnnn ".  The first number is the X coordinate of the move or draw.  The second
number is the Y coordinate.  Coordinate pairs take 10 columns, so coordinate
pairs may appear in columns 14, 24, 34, etc. up to column 244.  The spaces
between numbers is ignored, and some sort of separator is recommended.
 
There are two special commands that may appear.  The first is a pair of
numbers, "-256    0".  This signifies that the next pair of coordinates is a
"move".  Using a plotter analogy, this means to "lift the pen up and move to
the next pair of coordinates".  The second special command is, "-256 -256".
This signifies the end of character description.  Character descriptions may be
continued across several lines.
 
An example of a character description is:
 
SIMPROMPROA :   0   75:  38   88:   4    0:-256    0:  38   88:
            :  71    0:-256    0:  17   29:  58   29:-256 -256:
 
This defines the character "A" for the font "SIMPROMPRO".  The first pair of
numbers indicates that this character is 75 units wide.  The character is drawn
from 38,88 to 4,0.  Then a move is done to 38,88.  Another line is drawn to
71,0.  Again, a move is done to 17,29.  And a final line is drawn to 59,29.
