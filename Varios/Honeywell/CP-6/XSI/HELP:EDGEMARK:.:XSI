EDGEMARK is a program which may be used to copy a unit-record file to a printer
and put block letters on the top and bottom edges of the paper (i.e., so that
they are visible when the printout is bound into a book or other form of
binder).

10/13/86 - Fix for 23199 to report errors using M$SI and M$LO,
           and to be STDINVOC.
8/25/82 - Installed in X account.
EDGEMARK now honors the width defined for the specified output form, rather
than defaulting to a value of 108.
 
EDGEMARK now supports a "NOMORSE" option, which suppresses the generation of
Morse-code striping for small printouts in favor of the simple
two-indented-stripe system used by earlier versions of EDGEMARK.
 
The LEFTEDGE and RIGHTEDGE text strings may be specified without quotes, as
long as the strings do not contain ',' or ')' characters; EDGEMARK will assume
that the string(s) begin at the first non-blank character after the "=", and
end with the last character before the first ',', ')', or end-of-line.
TRAILING BLANKS ARE SIGNIFICANT IN THIS MODE!
8/18/82
If a listing file is too short to be word-marked (less than 21 pages), EDGEMARK
will now convert the LEFTEDGE text into International Morse Code, and print the
code as a series of vertical stripes.  This will result in a more unique
striping for short printouts than was previously available.

To enable the use of EDGEMARK, the system manager must create a logical printer
form which will permit EDGEMARK to print on the last physical line on the page.
This special form definition should specify:  (1) a FIRSTLINE value equal to
that of the standard form definition for this type of paper;  (2) a LENGTH
value equal to the sum of the LENGTH and LIMBO values specified for the
standard form;  (3) a LIMBO value of zero;  and (4) an alignment image which
specifies that a full row of '$' characters is to be printed on the last line
of the page.  When this form is mounted by the system operator, it should be
"misaligned" vertically by 1/2 character position (1/12 or 1/16 of an inch) so
that the last line printed on each page is printed across the perforation.
 
EDGEMARK has been written to make an automatic assumption about the name of the
form to be used for edgemarking purposes.  When ordered to edgemark a file, the
file's FIT is examined to determine the logical form name used to create the
file (the default being "STDLP").  If the name of the original form is
"STDLPx", where "x" is a string of 0, 1, or 2 characters, EDGEMARK will assume
that a form name of "PERFx" should be used to create the output file.  Thus
(for example), an input form name of "STDLP" will result in an output form name
of "PERF", while an input form name of "STDLP8" will result in an output form
name of "PERF8".  If the name of the input form is not "STDLPx", EDGEMARK will
make no assumption, and the default form for the output device (as defined by
the site manager) will be used unless the user species the "FORM=name" option
when invoking EDGEMARK.
 
The process of managing edge-marked forms can be made much easier if your site
uses specially-screened line-printer paper, and if all of your line printers
are capable of adjusting the vertical paper position by at least 1/2 line.  If
you can persuade the company which screens your paper to change to a slightly
different mask (with all of the lines, bars, logos, etc. being printed 1/2 line
lower on the page), you will be able to permanently align your printers for
edge-marking, by leaving the above-mentioned "misalignment" in effect at all
times.  If this is done, the printer will correctly place all printed
characters neatly within the color bars, and will print the "last line on each
page" directly ACROSS the end-of-page perforation.  You may then define the
"PERF" form as a CP-6 "pseudo form" version of the "STDLP" form;  EDGEMARK'ed
files will print out correctly without requiring operator intervention or the
realignment of the paper.  As an additional, beneficial side effect, normal
(non- EDGEMARK) CP-6 forms can be defined with a banner containing a row of "$"
characters on the "last line on the page";  this row will be printed directly
across the end-of-page perforation, and will be highly visible when a stack of
paper is removed from the printer, thus making it easier to separate printouts
without error.  This method has been used at Bull's Los Angeles
Development Center since 1980, with much success and no problems.
Command format:
 
!EDGEMARK.X sourcefile ON destination [ (options) ]
 
"sourcefile" must be a unit-record-formatted disk or tape file.
"destination" may be a logical stream (e.g., "LP01"), a symbiont device (e.g.,
"LP@LOCAL") or another unit record file (e.g., "MARKED_LISTING").
 
Type !HELP (EDGEMARK.X) OPTIONS for further information.
 
EDGEMARK determines the size of letters to be printed based on the number of
pages that will be generated (which information is determined by examining the
FIT of the unit-record file being processed).
 
   -  EDGEMARK will not attempt to word-mark a printout if it is less that 21
pages long, as the letters would be unreadable;  instead, EDGEMARK will print a
set of vertical stripes to distinguish the printout from those around it.
Normally, EDGEMARK will convert the LEFTEDGE text into International Morse
Code, and will print stripes of 1 column ("dit") and 2 columns ("dah") to spell
out the text;  if the NOMORSE option is specified, EDGEMARK will print one
1-column stripe near the left edge of the printout, and another near the right
edge.
 
   -  For listings of between 21 and 150 pages, EDGEMARK will automatically
switch into NARROW mode to enhance the readability of the letters.
 
   -  For listings of between 150 and 300 pages, EDGEMARK will print wide
letters unless there is insufficient room to do so (and unless the user
specified the NARROW option).
 
   -  For listings of greater than 300 pages, EDGEMARK will logically divide
the listing into smaller sections (as many evenly-sized sections as possible
such that each section is at least 150 pages long) and will repeat the
lettering on each section.  EDGEMARK will use wide letters unless there is
insufficient space for them (and unless the user specified the NARROW option).
If there is sufficient blank space (10 columns) between the end of the LEFTEDGE
text and the beginning of the RIGHTEDGE text (or the respective edges of the
page if the options are not specified), EDGEMARK will print a series of
diagonal "continuity stripes" running down the full thickness of the printout
(unless the user suppresses the stripes with the NOSTRIPE option).

NOTES:
 
An attempt to EDGEMARK a file produced by certain A00 processors (notably PCL)
will produce strange symptoms - the printout will run down to and across the
perforation, and no edge marking will occur.  This problem can be cured
(mostly) by simply COPYing such files over themselves on an A01 (or later) CP-6
system, or by re-running the program or job that created them in the first
place.
NOTES
Options:
 
L/EFTEDGE = text        specifies a text string to be printed at the left edge
of the bound listing.  Default is the filename portion of the "sourcefid" field
(e.g, if the user issues the command "!EDGEMARK DP#LIST/TRA$HCAN.:A00LS ON
LP@", the default LEFTEDGE text will be 'TRA$HCAN').
 
The 'text' specified for this option may be in one of two forms:
 
1) A string of characters, delimited by single quotes.
 
2) A string of characters, not delimited by quotes, which does not
   include either of the characters ',' or ')'.
 
R/IGHTEDGE = text       specifies a text string to be printed at the right edge
of the bound listing.   Default is the null string.  As with the LEFTEDGE
option, the text may be either a quoted string, or an unquoted string which
does not contain ',' or ')'.
 
F/ORMNAME = formname    specifies the name of the printer form on which the
output is to be produced;  this option may be used to over-ride EDGEMARK's
assumption about the form name to be used, or to provide a form name if
EDGEMARK is unable to determine a suitable form name.  See the "FORM" topic for
further details.  The form name may be specified with or without quotes, if the
first character is alphabetic and the name contains only legal "symbol"
characters (see CE33, section 10); any other type of form name must be
surrounded by quote characters.
 
M/ARKCHARS = 'string'   specifies one or more characters which are to be used
to generate the block letters.  Default is 'HZ$'.
 
P/AGEWIDTH = n          specifies that the final page is to be "n" columns
wide;  see below for notes.  Default is the width of the output device minus 1,
or 140 (whichever is less).
 
NA/RROW                 specifies that narrow (six-column) block letters are to
be produced, rather than the default of 8-column letters.
 
NO/STRIPE               specifies that, if EDGEMARK decides to repeat the
titling information more than once due to the length of the printout (greater
than 300 pages), it should not put the "continuity stripes" in the center
section of the edge printing (see below for an explanation of "continuity
stripes").
 
B/REAKAFTER = n         specifies that, when EDGEMARK finishes transferring
"source" to "destination", it is to check to see how many (total) pages have
been written to "destination";  if at least "n" have been written, EDGEMARK
will package the output via LDEV and send it to the printer before exiting.
(Note - this applies only when "destination" is a logical stream such as
"LP02".  If "destination" is a direct symbiont assignment such as "LP@", the
output is always packaged when EDGEMARK exits).  Default is a number so large
that you would saturate the :SYMO account before a file break was induced.

WIDTH
WIDTH
If the default page width is used, EDGEMARK can print 13 characters across the
page in wide mode, and 18 in NARROW mode.  If a PAGEWIDTH of 132 is specified,
EDGEMARK can print 16 characters in wide mode or 22 in NARROW.
 
If both LEFTEDGE and RIGHTEDGE are specified, EDGEMARK will attempt to
guarantee that a "blank" blockletter position separates them;  if necessary, it
will switch into NARROW mode to ensure this.  If the combined lengths of the
LEFTEDGE and RIGHTEDGE text is too great, the last portion of the LEFTEDGE
string will overlap and replace the left edge of the RIGHTEDGE string.
