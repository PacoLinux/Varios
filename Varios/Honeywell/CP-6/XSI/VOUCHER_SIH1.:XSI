.*A*                              
VOUCHER is a tool to enter hours worked for specific projects'
activities.  All data is retrieved and written to the EARS_xx.account
ARES personnel database where xx is the current year.  Data is input
via FORGE forms.
.*B*
To invoke type at the IBEX prompt:
 
!VOUCHER.X [({-|+|-x|+x|xx})]
 
    where
        -   make the current week last week.
        +   make the current week next week.
    -x,+x   x is a digit in the range of 1-9 indicating the offset to
            the target week.  (i.e.: if the current week is 5, then
            !VOUCHER.X (+2) would place you in week 7.)
       xx   is the target week.  (i.e.: !VOUCHER.X (33) would put you
            in week 33.)
 
.*B*
Hit a ? in the first position of any field to get help for that field.
 
A few things should be mentioned for those who aren't familiar with
FORGE forms.  To move forward through the fields, hit <TAB>.  To
move backwards, hit <BACKSPACE>.  That's a HT and BS, respectively,
for those who want to IMP the arrow keys (for PCT terminals, you must
be in KEYPAD mode where <Alt-K> toggles KEYPAD/SCROLL)  Or, you can
define your <Shift Tab> to be a BS to imitate SQL*Forms on PCs.
 
Signal FORGE to process your input by hitting <Enter>.
 
To REFRESH the screen type the following:
        <Ctrl Y>        (goes to the IBEX window)
        <Esc> <->       (does the screen refresh)
        GO              (goes back into the form)
        <CR>            (resets the form, only needed for Daily form)
 
All fields are case insensitive.  All input will be converted to
uppercase.
.*B*
There are three forms used for this program:
        Daily, Weekly and Information forms
 
Each form is identified in the center of the top line.
 
When you enter the program, you will be on the Daily form in the
current week on the current day in the Hours field of your first
predefined prompt.  Fields that you may alter (denoted by reverse
video) are Hours, Project, Description, Activity, Day and Week.  To
reach the Day and Week fields, hit <BS> once and twice, respectively,
from the first predefined prompt.
 
To exit the program, <BS> to the Day field and use a E, Q or X to exit.
 
For further information for a form, type one of the following:
!HELP (VOUCHER.X) DAILY_FORM
!HELP (VOUCHER.X) WEEKLY_FORM
!HELP (VOUCHER.X) INFO_FORM
.*K* DAILY_FORM
The Daily form is the initial form seen when entering the program.  The
form has a header at line 1 consisting of the title, formname, Week and
Day fields.  Line 2 is the error/information line.  Line 3 is blank.
Line 4 has column titles of Project, Description, Activity, Mon, Tue,
Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat and Sun.  The next 17 lines serve as a window for
your list of prompts/projects.  The line after that is the Totals
line that displays the Week Total and the Daily Totals.
 
To voucher hours for a project, <TAB> or <BS> to the line that has the
project (and activity, if applicable) and type the hours worked.  Use
only quarter hour increments.  Each field already has a decimal place
and your input will be formatted, so '7 . 5' is okay and will be
converted to ' 7.50'.  Notice that this leaves a space at the beginning
of the field for the Control Character (CC), if needed.
 
The < and > CCs are double duty.  Used with Move, they indicate the
destination of the Moved project.  Used alone, they denote where to
insert a new predefined prompt (one that you are always prompted for).
 
To add a non-predefined prompt, simply use the blank spaces at the
bottom of your list of projects.  Non-predefined projects will have
an * appended to their project number.  For your convevience, you
may Move a non-predefined project into your predefined area and make
it predefined, thus losing its *.
 
When adding prompts, only a Project or Description is needed.  If you
want to add a project that you know is a Metrics one, just enter the
six character project number and the activity code (or ALL).  If the
project number entered is not Metrics, the activity field will be
cleared.
 
This form will also be used to display the data for a closed week, if
possible, according to the information in the database.  In addition to
the Week and Day fields, only the hours adjacent to the projects will be
open, but only for scrolling CCs.  Any hour value altered will be reset
to its original value.
 
The following is a list of fields that can be altered and their
Control Characters (CCs):
 
Field name      CC  Description and information

The Weekly form is reached when one selects a fiscal week that is
closed to input.  The form has a header at line 1 consisting of a title,
formname, and the Week field.  Line 2 is the error/information field.
Line 4 has the column headings:  Project, Description, and Hours.
Notice that this form omits the activity field.  The Hours are totaled
by project.  The bottom line has the Weekly Total.
 
If you reach this form by accident (or forgot what week you were on in
the Daily form) merely use the = control character to reset the week
to be the week chosen before coming to this form.
 
Only one field is open for input, and it is described below.

.*K* INFO_FORM
The Information form is reached when adding a wildcarded prompt that
results in more than one choice.
 
This screen is similar to the daily form with the exception that where
the daily hours are, there now is a list of possible matches to your
wildcarded Project and/or Description.  There will be a column before
the list called the Command column.  Scroll the list of possible matches
with Top, Bottom, Next and Previous CCs.  If no CC is input and <Enter>
is hit, it is assumed that you did not find what you were looking for,
and your Project and/or Description is cleared, and you may enter new
information in the Project, Description and Activity fields.  Leave
them blank and hit <Enter> to delete the entry.
 
There will be a > in the seventh position of the Project field
after the project number to indicate the line that will be affected
by this operation.
 
Once you reach this form, you will stay there to do the rest of your
adds (if applicable).

.*K* CREATOR
If a user has CREATOR privileges, entering CHA in the Day field of the
Daily form will allow the user to change employee numbers.  This enables
authorized personnel to voucher for people who are out of the office.
.*B*
After entering CHA in the Day field of the Daily form, the form will be
cleared.  The Week Total field will be filled with the current employee
number, and it will be in reverse video.  At this point, the user may
enter a new employee number.  If the new number is not valid, the
current employee number is redisplayed.
 
If the field is cleared, the user's original employee number will be used.
 
Once a valid number is obtained, the user will be returned to the Daily
form with the proper list of prompts, ready for input.
