.*A*                                             
LOON (Lookup Of Our Names) reports the MAIL users associated with a given logon
account, or the logon accounts associated with a given MAIL user.
.*B*
Invocation syntax is:
 (There are no options, wildcarding is allways on)
 !LOON        "If it's installed in :SYS
  or
 !LOON.X      "If the logon account has read access to :NAME.:MAIL
.*B*
LOON first prompts with 'Enter a name:'.  In this mode, LOON will read the
input as a name and look for an associated account to output.
 
Entering a period will toggle to the account mode where the prompt is 'Enter an
account:'.  In this mode, LOON will read the input as an account specification
and look for the associated names to output.  LOON may list more than one name
if there are multiple user names registered in MAIL for this one account.
 
The two modes can be toggled between by entering a period ('.') as the first
character to either prompt.  A blank terminates LOON.
.*B*
Both modes do wild-carding.  The wildcard character is a question mark '?'.
Wildcarding is done via the XUW$WILDCMP library facility.
 
The name mode is case insensitive (everything is converted to upper case).  The
account mode is case sensitive.
.*B*
LOON MUST be run either by a logon user with READ access to the :NAME.:MAIL
file, or from the :SYS account.
.*K* WILDCARDING
Both modes do wild-carding.  The wildcard character is a question mark '?'.

.*K* NAME_MODE

associated account to output.
.*K* ACCOUNT_MODE

specification and look for the associated names to output.  LOON may list more
