SUBSCRIBE is a program to print overstruck block-letter signs, with a border,
in landscape mode at 8 lines per inch.
Invocation syntax:
 
!SUBSCRIBE.X input_data OVER output_file
 
Where:
input_data     is a file of at least seven records in the format described
below.
 
output_file    is a file in which the output banner is to be stored.  On CP-6
it can be LP.
 
The block letters on the sign are designed to be printed on continuous form, at
least 130 columns wide, at eight lines per inch.  At LADC, the form 'WIDE8'
should be used for best results.
The input_data consists of sets of 7 records, read from command line DCB 1 (or
COBOL FD THE-CHARACTERS). The first record is of the form ",,nn", where nn =
the width of the sign in letters. The next six records contain the data for the
6 lines of the sign. Only the first nn positions of each record are used. This
set of records may be repeated as often as desired.
The output is written on command line DCB 3 (or COBOL FD SIGNS).
This program was ripped off from the punched output bins of the University of
Arizona Computer Center in Tucson (where it was originally written by Conrad
Schneiker). It migrated to CP-6 07/03/80.  The following changes were
made:
1) data table consolidated to "X" constants only; "O" constants now generated
by "EXAMINE...REPLACING".
2) collating sequence changed to ASCII (from BCD).
3) additional characters were added, including "@`[\]^_{|}~".
4) odd characters were deleted from the original table like left-double-quote,
Conrad Schneiker's monogram, heart, cent-sign, extra-thin-slash.
5) existing right and left arrows were replaced by greater-than and less-than
signs.
6) checking for out-of-range character routine added; always maps
non-acceptables onto space.
7) lower-to-uppercase mapping added (in deference to adding lowercase
characters; letter size is too big to allow decent lowercase).
8) asterisk made more star-like.
9) squote made more recognizable.
10) value clauses for data statements changed to PIC X(20) from PIC X(200) for
ANS COBOL purposes and readability purposes.
The VFC characters used in this program for CP-6 use are as follows:
p - lowercase "P" means advance to top-of-page and upspace 0 lines.
@ - "at" sign means print and upspace 0 lines.
a - capital "A" means print and upspace 1 line.
