SWAN: A program that handles the SWAN (level 6 SoftWare ANalyzer).
 
Syntax: !SWAN.X
 
The SWAN program has a HOST and a FEP FPRG component.  It is used to boot
firmware into the board, disable cache in the FEP and dump the contents of the
SILO (a circular buffer that monitors buss traffic).  The relevant commands in
SWAN are L, C and D, respectively.  The user must be able to run FPRGs.  Also
(of course), there must be a SWAN installed in the FEP.  The intended audience
of this tool is the Level 6 hardware specialist group, since they're the ones
with the SWAN boards.
 
 
Example:
 
        !SWAN
        Enter FEP# (DD):  2               FEP02 has a SWAN
        Command (L,C,D,Q,?):  L           Load firmware into the SWAN
        Firmware size = 32768 Bytes.
        SWAN firmware successfully loaded.
        Command (L,C,D,Q,?):  ?
          L - Load SWAN Firmware
          C - Disable FEP Cache
          D - Dump the SWAN SILO
          Q - Quit
          ? - This message
        Command (L,C,D,Q,?):  C
        Cache disabled                    Cache is disabled in FEP02
        Command (L,C,D,Q,?):  Q
