FERRET produces a list of files, sorted by the file's creator, that have not
been accessed or modified since a specified time, or have been left open due to
a catastrophic system failure.
FERRET is invoked as:
 
!FERRET.X [ON ,lofile] [(options)]
 
In order to list files by the creator name or use the OPEN option, FMS
privilege must be turned on before FERRET is invoked.  In order to use only
packset names, or wild-carded account name, FMS or FMR is needed.
 
The listing is produced through M$LO.  Diagnostics are produced through M$DO.
FERRET uses a temp file '*LIST FILE' for storing information.

The default for where to search is the current file management account.
 
If neither ACCESS or MODIFY have been specified, then "ACC=6 MONTHS" is
assumed.
 
Some examples are:
 
!FERRET.X
 
would produce a list of files that have not been accessed in six months, in the
current file management account.
 
!FERRET.X ((DP#PACK1, DP#PACK2), ACC=1 YEAR)
 
would produce a list of files that have not been accessed in one year, on the
packsets "#PACK1" or "#PACK2".
 
!FERRET.X (.ACCOUNT, MOD=6 MONTHS)
 
would produce a list of files that have not been modified in six months for the
account ".ACCOUNT".
 
!FERRET.X (.?, OPEN)
 
would search the public account list (MAD) for any file left open due to a
catastrophic system failure.
 
FERRET has four basic options.  These are:
 
1).  Where to search (WHERE)
 
2).  Access time limit (ACCESS)
 
3).  Modify time limit (MODIFY)
 
4).  Search for files left open due to a catastrophic system failure (OPEN)
 
For more details on a specific option, type:
 
!HELP (FERRET.X) OPTIONS option_name
 
For a descriptions of all options, type:  "??".
 
Where to search is specified by an account or list of accounts.  Account names
may be wildcarded.  If only the packset portion of account name is specified,
then all accounts in that packset are searched.  If nothing is specified for
where to search, then the current file management account is searched.
 
For example:
 
!FERRET.X (DP#PACK)
 
Would search the packset "#PACK".
 
!FERRET.X ((.ABC, DP#PACK.XYZ))
 
Would search accounts ".ABC" and "DP#PACK.XYZ".
 
!FERRET.X (DP#PACK.?123)
 
Would search any account that ended in "123" on the pack "PACK".
 
The ACCESS options indicates that files that have not been accessed since the
specified time are to be listed.  The command is specified as:
"ACC[ESS] = time".
For details on the format of "time", type:
 
!HELP (FERRET.X) TIME
 
The MODIFY option indicates that files that have not been modified since the
specified time are to be listed.  The command is specified as:
"MOD[IFY] = time".
For details on the format of "time", type:
 
!HELP (FERRET.X) TIME
 
In the event of a catastrophic system failure, for example a power failure,
file management may not have had a chance to close any open files.  FERRET can
search for files that were left open.  When FERRET finds a file that was left
open, if it is a consecutive, IDS, indexed, keyed, random, or relative file,
FERRET will re-open the file, and read through it looking for file
inconsistancies.  The syntax is simply:
 
!FERRET.X (OPEN)
 
00002
00003
00004
00001
Richard Petkiewicz, LADC
Times for the ACCESS and MODIFY options may be specified as either a date in
the form of "mm/dd/yy", or as a span of time.  Time spans are indicated by a
number followed by:  D[AYS], W[EEKS], M[ONTHS], Y[EARS].  For example:
 
!FERRET.X (ACC=6/6/82)
 
Would produce a list of files that have not been accessed since June 6, 1982.
 
!FERRET.X (MOD=2 YEARS)
 
Would produce a list of files that have not been modified for two years or
more.
 
FERRET.X
AID=SYSTEM_MANAGEMENT
FILE_MAINTENANCE
TOOL=FERRET
Produces a list of files, sorted by the file's creator, that have not been
accessed or modified since a specified time, or have been left open due to a
catastrophic system failure.
