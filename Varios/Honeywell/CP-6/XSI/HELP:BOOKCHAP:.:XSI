BOOKCHAP is a tool used to separate a "book" file (created by CHAPBOOK.X) back
into its respective "chapter" files.
Command syntax:
 
  !BOOKCHAP.X fid1 [TO/ON/OVER/INTO ofid] [(S/TART='start mark',E/ND='end
mark'[)]]
 
where:
 fid1 - the "book" file which you wish to be separated.
 ofid - fid specifying the account where the "chapter" files to be created.
 start mark - the prefix mark which determine when a "chapter" break occurs.
 end mark - the suffix mark which will determine when a "chapter" break has
occured.
 
If the starting and ending marks are not specified the defaults are obtained
from the first record of the "book" file, if that contains its name.  That will
be the case if the file was created by CHAPBOOK.  If the first record doesn't
contain the file's name, the default start mark is '.***** ' and end mark is '
*****'.
If ofid has a name portion containing a '?', the output file names are created
by replacing the '?' with the "chapter" name (the portion of a chapter
separation record between the start mark and the end mark).
For more information type !HELP (CHAPBOOK.X).
No more help is available for BOOKCHAP.

2/25/92 - par. Added outfile name modification and allowed garbage at the
front.
          to make it more useful for building helpfiles (e.g., HA26).

Fixed bug that would trash the input file if the marks are specified on the
command line.

Installed in LADC X account.
It is no longer neccessary to put the starting or ending marks on the command
line. Even if you didn't use the default marks, the program can now figure out
what the marks were. BUT this will only work for "books" created after
09/27/84.
