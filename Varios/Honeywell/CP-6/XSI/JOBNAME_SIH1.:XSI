JOBNAME is used to change the jobname in an online or ghost user's jit.
.*B*
JOBNAME can be used one of three ways:
 
   o  To change a jobname
           !JOBNAME jobname
 
   o  To display a jobname
           !JOBNAME
 
   o  To remove a jobname
           !JOBNAME (REM/OVE)
 
Output created by a user of JOBNAME will have established a jobname that can
apear on printed output banners or anywhere else jobnames normally appear.
.*K* INSTALLATION
In order to work properly, JOBNAME must be installed in the system account
(:SYS) or be run from an account with JIT privilege.

Print out an error message if user does not have JIT priv in

Fixed a parse bug which required a space after a request to display the current
jobname, and a bug that caused ldevs to be created if they did not exist.
