FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of

.*A*
PROOF.X is a document proofreader, for detecting and reporting misspelled words
in TEXT and CAP documents.
.*B*
Command line syntax:
 
    !PROOF.X  filename[,dictname][ ON,LP[@station]][(options)]
 
"filename" is the name of the document you wish to have proofread.  "dictname"
is the name of an optional alternate dictionary, which will be read in place of
or in addition to the primary dictionary; if not specified, PROOF will attempt
to open the file PROOF_DIC in the current file management account as the
alternate dictionary.  If the "ON,LP" option is omitted, the output is directed
to the user's terminal.  Options allowed are:
 
[N]LS   - list source document  (NLS)
.*R*
[N]R    - list misspelled word record numbers  (R)
.*R*
PO      - use primary dictionary, PROOF_DIC.X, only
.*R*
AO      - use alternate dictionary, dictname, only
.*R*
[N]ID   - invert dictionary (report only good words) (NID)
.*R*
[NO]TX   - ignore any TEX controls in the document (skip them)
.*R*
.*R*
[N]TC   - search text commands for misspellings (TC)
.*R*
WF=n    - report the word frequencies of the top "n" words found

o [N]LS        <[N]LIS[T]>
 
LS specifies you want PROOF to produce a listing of the document with line
numbers (or EDIT keys) on your terminal.  NLS says you only want to see the
proofreader results.  NLS is the default.
 
o [N]R         <[N]R[EFERENCES]>    <[N]LIN[ES]>
 
NR specifies you want PROOF to produce only the alphabetized list of
"misspelled" words, without reference lines or EDIT keys.
 
o PO           <PR[IMARY]>
 
PO specifies that you want PROOF to use the primary dictionary (PROOF_DIC.X)
only.  Any specification for "dictname" will be ignored.

o AO           <ALT[ERNATE]>
 
AO specifies you want PROOF to use only the alternate dictionary when looking
up words.  Thus, eight dictionary combinations are possible:

o [N]ID                <[N]INV[ERT]>
 
ID specifies that the dictionary (or dictionaries) is to be "inverted"; that
is, words FOUND in the dictionary file(s) will be cross-referenced and
undefined words will be discarded.  This option is useful for producing
cross-reference listings for keywords by line numbers.
 
o [NO]TX
 
TX specifies that TEX controls are to be ignored and skipped over.  A TEX
control is anything between an introducer '\' and the left delimiter '{'. NOTX
means to process the controls. Default is NOTX.
 
o [N]TC             <[N]TEXT>
 
NTC specifies that TEXT commands ("." in column one) are to be totally ignored;
normally, PROOF discards the first "word" on the command line and scans the
remainder of the line for user variable names to cross-reference.  If NTC is
specified, the entire line is ignored.
 
o WF=n              <W[ORDFREQUENCY]=n>
 
WF specifies that PROOF examine its list of qualified words (spelled or
misspelled, depending on the ID option), and print the "n" most frequently
occurring words.  Output is printed as five columns of count, space, word.
Words occurring only once are not reported.  Maximum of 99 words can be
reported.
.*B* OPERATIONS HOW_IT_WORKS
PROOF proofreads a document by reading it and dividing the text into "words"
and looking up the words in a dictionary.  Words that aren't found in the
dictionary are collected, sorted into alphabetic order, and printed with line
references (or EDIT keys) on which the word was found.  PROOF may also be used
to proofread an error message file; in this case, the error message file key is
printed in the form "fcg-Merror-sev/line" on both the LS listing and the
references listing.  "line" is the 3-digit sequential line number used in the
error message file key for multi-line errors.

A "word" is any contiguous combination of letters (upper and lower case),
numerals, hyphens (-), dollar signs ($), pound signs (#), percent signs (%), at
signs (@), underscores (_), and single quotes ('), EXCEPT (a) a string of all
numbers is not a word, (b) leading hyphens and quotes are ignored, (c) trailing
hyphens and quotes are ignored, and (d) a word containing two or more
consecutive hyphens is split and considered to be two words.  The following are
words:
 
    A                            pferdfeathers
    Fifty-five                   1-to-1
    author's                     GARBAGE
    CP6                          aBcDe
 
The following are not words:
 
    1979                         --simply
    'CHARS''                     FEP--however
    ---------                    ''''
 
Of the "not words" above, 'CHARS'', --simply, and FEP--however would be changed
into CHARS, simply, and FEP and however, making them "words" by the above
definition.

Unlike the CP-V version of the proofreader, PROOF for CP-6 does not read the
entire dictionary file for every document; therefore, large and small documents
can be proofread without incurring a great deal of system overhead.  CP-6
PROOF's speed is dependent on the number of DIFFERENT words in a document;
typical speed with several samples taken from our current documentation was
about 3,000 lines per CPU minute.  Of course, this will vary with the number of
different words, the number of words not found in the dictionary, and the
number of references to those words.
 
Input is assumed to be unencrypted text in either EDIT or TEXT formats;
embedded TEXT commands ("." in column 1) are ignored.  Maximum input record
length is 256 characters.  Output adjusts for the WIDTH of the output device
automatically.
 
Our dictionary file is reasonably small at this time, but it is growing as more
documents are proofread and the new words are added to the dictionary (I do
this by hand).  There are about 35,000 words in our current file.

PROOF matches words from the text with words from the dictionary using the
following algorithm:
 
o If the word is in all upper case characters, it is left as is.
 
o If the word begins with a capital and ends in all lower case characters, the
word is translated to all upper case.
 
o If the word contains all lower case characters, it is translated to all upper
case.
 
o If none of the above is true, the word is left as is.
 
Thus, "PROOF", "Proof", and "proof" all match the dictionary entry "PROOF".
However, "pRoof" will only match "pRoof" in the dictionary.  For the purposes
of comparison, quotes, numbers, and hyphens are considered both upper and lower
case.

By default, PROOF "asks" SORT to not print anything unless there are SORT
errors.  If you wish to force SORT to say something, simply do a !LET
SORT$STAT='whatever-you-like' prior to invoking PROOF.
 
Output from PROOF consists of an (optional) listing of the source file, each
line preceded by a line number or EDIT key.  PROOF then summarizes the document
contents by telling you how many words it found, how many unique (different)
words, how many "undefined" words (not in the dictionary), and how many
references it is going to print.  If the number of references is large, you may
want to control-Y out of PROOF and send your output to a line printer; you can
do this during the call to SORT after the "... reference(s) to undefened
word(s)" message prints by typing
 
    (control-Y)
    !!SET M$LO LP
    !!GO
 
After the SORT finishes, PROOF will print the alphabetized list of possibly
misspelled words.  Each word is presented on a separate line and the line
numbers or EDIT keys of the lines on which it is referenced are printed on
succeeding lines.  Note that in CP-6 numbers precede uppercase letters precede
lowercase letters.
 
Examine your list of "misspelled" words CAREFULLY!  It is very easy to overlook
the fact that a word is missing a double "l" or has too many "m"'s, etc.  You
may also discover that you have been misspelling a word consistently because
you really didn't know how it is spelled.  When in doubt, look it up!  (See
PERUSE.X)
 
If you use PROOF to scan a document and find a large number of
correctly-spelled words which aren't in the dictionary, please pass the listing
on to me with those words circled and I will enter them into the dictionary.
Only good English "semi-technical" words will be considered for the dictionary;
mnemonics (such as COBOL, NETCON), abbreviations (he'd, can't), and made-up or
hyphenated words (made-up, stationname) are not good words to enter in the
file.
 
B01 PROOF incorporates a new sorting algorithm which eliminates the "double
alphabet" syndrome:  Upper and lower case versions of the same "word" are now
printed adjacent to each other, so that only one A to Z listing is produced.
This version also tries to interpret overstruck characters in an intelligent
manner, such as underlined words or phrases.  The character set defining a
"word" has also been expanded on a trial basis to include #$%_@, which are
defined to be "numbers".
