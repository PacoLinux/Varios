FORTSORT eats FORTRAN source files and spits them back out with the functions
and subroutines sorted in alphabetical order.
Command line syntax:
 
    !FORTSORT.X infile {TO|ON|INTO|OVER} outfile
 
where:
 filein  --  FORTRAN source code input file. (F$1)
 fileout --  Ordered FORTRAN source code output file. (F$2)
 
FORTSORT prompts for options.
Description:
 
FORTSORT takes your FORTRAN source code file and puts the program units in
alphabetical order in the output file.  It does this by creating temporary
files for each program unit identified with the prefix "**ofs-", followed by
the name of the program unit.  These files are then concatenated into the
output file in alphabetical order.
 
You have the option of requesting that the main program unit be placed first in
the output source code.  This is accomplished by preceding the name of the
temporary file containing this program unit with a currency symbol.  If you do
not use a PROGRAM statement to name the main program unit, it will default to
having the name "4MAIN".
 
You also have the option of specifying the EDIT key increment value on the
output file.  The program will default to "1.000" if no value is entered.
Caveats:
 
Although every attempt has been made to account for the wide variety of
programming styles, this program may error on specific eccentric forms.  One
programming style which will not be correctly ordered is Free Form.  (If you
code in Free Form, why would you want to put any order into your code?) Also
note that if you have any files that begin with the prefix "**ofs-", these will
probably end up in your output source code file.
 
    Current limits on source code:
         200 comment lines prior to program unit identifier.
         9999 lines in any single program unit.
