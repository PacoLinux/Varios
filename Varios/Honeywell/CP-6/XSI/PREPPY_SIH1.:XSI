FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=80)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
PREPPY is a standalone version of the PL-6 preprocessor.  PREPPY takes source
and update files containing preprocessor directives and outputs the
preprocessed source.
.*B*
Command line syntax:
 
 !PREPPY.X [fid1] [,fid2] [{ON|OVER|INTO} [fid3] [,fid4]] [(optionlist)]
 
where:
 
fid1 specifies the fid that contains the source.
 
fid2 specifies the fid that contains source updates.
 
fid3 specifies the fid to contain the preprocessed source.
     (defaults to *PREPPY)
 
fid4 specifies the fid of the listing output destination.
 
.*B*
Type HELP (PREPPY.X) TOPICS for a list of related topics.
 
Type HELP (PL6) PREPROCESSOR for additional information on the PL-6
preprocessor or refer to Section 12 of Manual CE44-01, the CP-6 PL-6 Reference
Manual.

For information on the help facility type HELP HELP.
 
.*K* OPTIONS Options options
Help is available for the following PREPPY options:
 
   BC      CP6       CSYS      EOD         FEP     FOR/MAT
   LS      LU        NEOD      NFOR/MAT    NLU

Type HELP (PREPPY.X) OPTIONS option for help on a specific option.
.*B* BC
 
BC[(list)]     - specifies which procedures from the source file are to be
preprocessed.
 
.*B*
The list is a sequence of numbers indicating procedures to be preprocessed,
separated by commas, or is the word ALL.
 
.*B*
The procedures in the source file are delimited by the preprocessor directive
%EOD.  The default is BC(ALL).
 
.*B* CP6
CP6            - specifies the CP-6 system.  This is the default.
 
.*B* FEP
 
FEP            - specifies the FEP system.
 
 
.*B* CSYS
 
CSYS           - specifies production of a system file on the M$SYSTEM DCB from
all MACRO, MAC, SET, EQU and SUB preprocessor commands in the first compile
unit.  Subsequent compile units in the same file will be processed with the
newly build system file.  This is off by default.
 
.*B* NSYS
 
NSYS           - don't use any system file and don't search :LIBRARY for any
include files.
 
.*B* SYS
 
SYS            - specifies use of a system file, if present, using M$SYSTEM
DCB.  This is the default.
 
.*B* FORMAT NFORMAT
FORMAT         - Format the source listing per the option list, as described in
Section 12 of Manual CE44, the CP-6 PL-6 Reference Manual.
 
NFORMAT        - Do not format the source listing.  This is the default.
 
.*B* LS  NLS
 
LS             - List the source program.  This is the default.
 
NLS            - Do not list the source program.
 
.*B* LU  NLU
 
LU             - List the update file before listing the source.
 
NLU            - Do not list the update file.  This is the default.
 
.*B* UI NUI
 
UI             - Use update input.
 
NUI            - Do not use update input.  This is the default unless a UI file
is specified on the invocation line.
 
.*B* USC NUSC
USC  -   Use the Standard Character Set.  This is the default.  The
preprocessor will give an error message for all illegal characters.
 
NUSC -   The preprocessor will allow illegal characters to pass without giving
an error message.  It is then the caller's responsibility to deal with the
illegal characters.
.*B* EOD  NEOD
 
EOD            - PREPPY writes a %EOD to the preprocessed source file between
external compile units.  This is the default.
 
NEOD           - Do not write %EOD to the preprocessed source.
 
.*B* WARN  NWARN
 
WARN           - List warning messages.
 
NWARN          - Do not generate warning messages.  This is the default.
 
.*B* SRCH
 
SRCH (list)    - This option augments the specification of the accounts and
packsets to be searched if PREPPY encounters an INCLUDE preprocessor directive
which specifies a file only by file name.
 
.*B*
The list is a list of accounts, possibly qualified by packset, separated by
commas.  Each account designation must have a leading period.
 
.*B*
A maximum of eight accounts may be specified.  If the file is not found in any
of these accounts, the :LIBRARY account and the user's running account will
then be searched.
