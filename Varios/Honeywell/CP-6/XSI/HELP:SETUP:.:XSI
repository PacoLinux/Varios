SETUP is the universal setup program.  It reads a control file from M$SI
which defaults to SETUP.current account.  It selects a control record from
those between 1. and 1.999 (1. must exist), whose format is:
PROFILENAME,[c],[baud],[imp-yc-xeq]
   if PROFILENAME is NONE, the profile is not changed.
   if PROFILENAME is NOPROMPT, no prompt for a profile change will occur
      if the baud-selected profile was on a previous record in the file.
      e.g. putting it first is useless, putting it last never prompts if
      all line speeds are represented (mayhap by a "1").
   c is an identifying character in case baud is incorrect.
      If the first c is present, all must be.  Otherwise, c defaults to the
      first character of PROFILENAME.  This character is obtained
      by SETUP via a timeout=1 read through M$UC or from the first byte
      of the filename in M$UI, if that's not a blank. The M$UI assignment
      even overrides NOPROMPT.
   baud is the baud rate which makes this record the default.  A value
      of one (1) means "anything else".
   imp-yc-xeq is the edit key for records to be either copied to the front-end
      if DVBYTE.TRANS is set (IMP OU records), or sent to IBEX via M$YC (with
      or without the bang) or copy to JF.  If one of these records is XON,
      subsequent ones are copied to JF until a XOFF record occurs.  If one
      says JUMP more-imp-yc-xeq, more-imp-yc-xeq is a new edit key (integer)
      to get more stuff to do.  JUMP doesn't affect XON/XOFF.
      These records are between imp-yc-xeq. and imp-yc-xeq.999.
      When no more records exist before imp-yc-xeq+1,  SETUP assumes JUMP 0.
It defaults T SI=10 (which can be overridden by YC commands).
For example: TI725,T,300,725 .. VIP7205,V,1,7205 .. TWU1003,3,,100
   At 100 are imp and IBEX records wanted for T, V, and U; at 725 and 7205
   are imp-ou records and IBEX commands specific to TI and VIP, followed by
   a 'JUMP 100' record.
That's all.  See P. Rumsey for suggestions/complaints.

10/29/84 Don't M$YC lots of trailing blanks (confuses C00 IBEX a bit).
11/18/83 Should allow "-" in profile names.
