BAR3D - 3-dimension Bar Graph Generator
.SPB 3
.ALL
.FIN
BAR3D may be used to generate 3-dimensional bar graphs of data.  The
X and Y axes are unit measurements, such as dates, salesmen,
widgets, etc.  The Z-axis represents the value of the intersection
of the X and Y measurements.  For example, if the X-axis represents
salesmen (J. Jones, T. Smith, M. Brown, etc.) and the Y-axis
represents years (1979, 1980, 1981, etc.), the Z-axis could
represent total sales, miles traveled, percentage of quota, and so
on.  Applications involving measurements which are not integer
values along two or more axes are better off using a fishnet type of
graph.

Using BAR3D
.SPB 1
.ALL
The user calls BAR3D from his FORTRAN program via the call
.SPB 1
    CALL BAR3D(array,m,n,x,y,rotate,elev,xsf,ysf,zsf)
.SPB 1
"array" is the array of Z-values, which must be short floating point
values.  The array is dimensioned "m" by "n" (i.e., DIMENSION
array(m,n)).  All the values in "array" must be non-negative
(negative values are treated as zeros).
.SPB 1
"m" is the number of X-elements and "n" is the number of
Y-elements.  These values must be positive, non-zero integers.
.SPB 1
"x" and "y" are the coordinates of the "origin" of the plot (see
below).  They must be expressed as floating point values in units.
.SPB 1
"rotate" is the angle of view in the horizontal plane, expressed in
degrees as a floating point value.  Angles which are multiple of 90
degrees (0, 90, 180, 360, -90) should be avoided.
.SPB 1
"elev" is the angle of view in the vertical plane, expressed in
degrees as a floating point value.  "elev" must be greater than zero
and less than 90.
.SPB 1
"xsf", "ysf", and "zsf" are scaling factors to be applied to the
X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis respectively.  BAR3D normally plots
square right prisms which are of unit width and depth and "Z" units
high.  This may not be the optimum shape when the magnitude of the Z
elements is quite large or if the number of X or Y elements far
exceeds the number in the other dimension.  A scaling specification
of .5 will multiply the size of the corresponding dimension by 1/2;
one of 2.0 will double that dimension.  Normally, 1.0 should be used
for all three scaling factors.  Note that the scaling is done prior
to any plot modification by the current value of FACTOR.

The relationship among the arguments can best be explained via the
use of a diagram:
.BRP 3
Figure 1 shows the relationship between m, n, x, and y.  Note that
x,y is the position of the corner of the drawing ON THE PAGE and
does not have anything to do with the "array" or its values.  The
X-direction, dimensioned "m",appears to increase upwards to the
right.  The Y-direction, dimensioned "n", appears to increase
upwards to the left.
.SPB 1
Figure 2 shows a top view of the plot to demonstrate the effects of
the rotation angle.  Angles of >0 to <90 degrees will produce a plot
with "array"(1,1) on the "front" corner.  Angles of >180 to <270
degrees will place "array"(m,n) on the "front" corner, effectively
viewing the plot from the back side.  Note that no matter what
corner of the plot is rotated to the front, the "X" direction is
always upwards to the right and the "Y" direction is always upwards
to the left.  BAR3D will compensate for the fact that one or both of
the array subscripts must be run backwards when the plot is viewed
from the sides or back.
.SPB 1
Figure 3 shows a side view of the plot to demonstrate the effects of
the elevation angle.  Values near zero degrees produce a "ground
level" view, whereas values near 90 degrees produce aerial views.

Figure 4 is a reference diagram for users who have special labelling
needs.

LBL3D
.SPB 2
.ALL
LBL3D is a subroutine which may be used to label coordinates on a
3-D bar graph.  The user must have used BAR3D PRIOR to calling
LBL3D, as BAR3D initializes some values in labeled common which
LBL3D must use.
.SPB 1
The calling sequence is
.SPB 1
    CALL LBL3D(string,n,x,y,z,h)
.SPB 1
"string" is the text of the label to be placed at the position
indicated.
.SPB 1
|"n"| is the number of characters in "string".  If "n" is negative,
the string is to be plotted parallel to the X-axis.  If "n" is
positive, the string is to be plotted parallel to the Y-axis.
(Remember that the X-axis goes upwards to the right and the Y-axis
goes upwards to the left).
.SPB 1
"x", "y", and "z" are the coordinates of the beginning or end of the
string, relative to 0,0.  Normally, one or two of these floating
point values will be zero, but LBL3D does not force any
restrictions.  Typically, labels are placed at X or Y coordinates of
 .5, 1.5, 2.5, and so on with a Y or X and Z coordinate of zero.
Labels for the Z-axis are normally plotted at zero X or Y and the
maximum Y or X with varying values of Z.
.SPB 1
"h" is the height of the letters in inches.  While X, Y, and Z will
be adjusted for the scaling factors specified in the original BAR3D
call, "h" will not.  The minimum value for "h" after FACTOR has been
applied is .1 inches.
.SPB 1
The labels are plotted with either the leading or ending character
flush with the X, Y, Z coordinate according to the following
algorithm:  If the string is to be plotted parallel to the X-axis
and the X coordinate is less than or equal to 1/2 of the number of
X-elements ("m" in the BAR3D call), the rightmost character of
"string" is positioned at X,Y,Z; otherwise, the leftmost character
is positioned there.  If the string is to be plotted parallel to the
Y-axis and the Y coordinate is less than or equal to 1/2 of the
number of Y-elements ("n" in the BAR3D call), the leftmost character
of "string" is positioned at X,Y,Z; otherwise, the rightmost
character is positioned there.  Thus, labels along the Y-axis
(plotted parallel to the X-axis) have their rightmost character
against the axis; labels along the X-axis have their leftmost
character against the axis.
