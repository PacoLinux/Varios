CALENDAR is a tool which will help the user's daily life by building and
displaying a personal calendar.  The name of the file used to store a
personal calendar is :CALENDAR.
 
CALENDAR also supports group calendars. These are composite calendars
summarizing the entries in the personal calendars of all users who are
attached to the group.
 
CALENDAR is invoked with the command:
 
    !CALENDAR.X [.acct]
 
If ".acct" is specified or the M$CALENDAR DCB is set to another account
then the :CALENDAR file in that account will be used.  Otherwise the
:CALENDAR file in the users logon account is accessed.  CALENDAR will
prompt with a colon (":").
 
Type 'HELP COMMANDS' for a list of CALENDAR commands.
Type 'HELP USING_GROUPS' for more information on group calendars.

Format: AT[TACH] [IN] fid [FOR] alias
 
    fid     - FID for group calendar to be attached
    alias   - name by which the user is known to the group
              (alphanumeric and period, eg: Joe, J.Q.Public)
 
The ATTACH command makes the user a member of a group calendar.  The
user must supply the FID for the group calendar and an alias by which
the user will be known to the group (such as the user's first name or
first initial and last name).
 
The group calendar must exist; an error is reported if it does not, or
if it is not a group calendar file.  To attach to a new group, the
CReate command must be used.
 
Type 'HELP USING_GROUPS' for more information on group calendars.
Format:  CA[NCEL] [ date [,] {time|event} ]
 
Type HELP SCHEDULE FORMAT for formats of date, time and event.
 
The CANCEL command allows the user to remove an appointment from the
calendar.  The user will be prompted for the date, and time or event
if they are not entered on the CANCEL command line.
 
Format:  CH[ANGE] [date[,]{time|event}[,]{D/ATE|T/IME|P/LACE|E/VENT|N/OTES}]
 
Type HELP SCHEDULE FORMAT for formats of date, time, and event.
If the event contains a comma, it MUST be enclosed in parenthesis.
The CHANGE command allows the user to reschedule an appointment, or
to change one of the fields in an appointment.
 
The user will be prompted for the date, time or event, and field name
of the appointment to be changed if this information is not entered
on the CHANGE command line.
 
When changing a field other than notes, the old value is displayed and the
user is prompted for the new value.
 
If the user specifies that the notes are to be changed, CALENDAR
will build temporary file containing the current notes and calls the
standard CP-6 line editor EDIT.  The notes may be modified using any of
the capabilities of EDIT.  The END command to EDIT will return control
to CALENDAR, which replaces the notes with the newly edited notes.

A group calendar is a composite calendar summarizing the contents of the
personal calendars for all members of the group.  Any member of a group
can display the composite schedule for part or all of the group to help
find a convenient time to schedule an event.
 
Group calendars are maintained by the members of the group.  Any user
can start a group (CREATE command) or make themselves a member of an
existing group (ATTACH command). A user can also remove himself from a
group he is attached to at any time (DETACH command).
 
Once attached to a group, all additions or changes to the user's
personal calendar are automatically applied to the group calendar.  Any
member of the group can display the composite schedule for a given date
or range of dates (GROUP command). The display can be for the entire
group, or the schedule for selected group members can be displayed.  It
is also possible to list the members of a group (MEMBERS command).

    Type 'HELP commandname SYNTAX' for detailed command syntax.
Group calendars are designed primarily to assist users in finding a
convenient time to schedule an event.  Typically, a group would be set
up for a small set of people who need to communicate with each other
about their work planning and scheduling. By displaying the group
calendar, any member of the group can see when the other group members
are free and when they are busy. In this way, group calendars make it
easier to resolve schedule conflicts when a meeting or other event
affects several group members.
 
The group calendar facility is intended as an aid in scheduling, but it
is not a universal scheduling or work planning system. The group
calendar simply tells the user that a group member is busy at a given
time; it does not tell how long he will be busy or for what reason.
Also, group members must keep their personal calendars complete and up
to date for the facility to be effective. Any potential conflicts must
be resolved outside of the system. Once a convenient time for an event
is found, it must be scheduled as is currently done.
 
    Type '?' for more information.
A user is known within a group by an "alias" supplied when he is
attached to the group. An alias consists of up to 15 alphabetic
characters and a period can be used for punctuation. For example,
"Tony", "T.Jones", and "DeForrest" are vaild aliases.
 
A user can be attached to up to 10 groups at a time.  There is no limit
to the number of members in a single group.
 
If a user is attached to more than one group, group calendar commands
must specify which group to access. The desired group can be indicated
by giving the FID for the group calendar file or by using the symbolic
name assigned to the group. This name is specified when the group is
created and can contain any characters legal in a FID.  The creator of a
group calendar should assign it a simple, meaningful name so that users
need not remember the full FID and account of the group file.
 
When CALENDAR is started, a display is produced showing all group
calendars that the user is attached to, their names, and the user's
alias in the group.
