                         WEBSTER
 
WEBSTER is used to maintain the dictionary file(s) for the
proofreader, PROOF.  Anyone may use WEBSTER to build a dictionary
file for use as an alternate dictionary for PROOF; only user with
access to PROOF_DIC.X may use WEBSTER to edit the "real"
dictionary.
 
.*B*
WEBSTER is invoked by typing
 
    !WEBSTER.X [dictionary][,command-stream]
 
If "dictionary" is omitted, PROOF_DIC.X is assumed (which is not
accessible to most people).  If you do
not have access to the dictionary specified, WEBSTER types
a system error message.  If the file is busy, WEBSTER will
wait up to five minutes for it to become free before giving
up.
 
If "command-stream" is omitted, commands are read from the CR# device,
which is the user's terminal in online sessions.  Commands are read
using the M$SI DCB.
 
Four commands are available:
 
o ADD
 
  The ADD command directs WEBSTER to insert words into the
  dictionary.  It may be used in two forms, open and closed.
  In the open form the user types ADD<return>.  WEBSTER will
  then prompt WORD? and the user enters one word per line.  A
  null line (<return> only) terminates the ADD function.  In
  the closed form the user types ADD word1[,word2]...; up to
  16 words can be added on the same line (or 256 characters, whichever
  comes first).  When adding words to the dictionary, PROOF
  will not comment if a duplicate is added; it is simply
  ignored.  Words are added as is except in the following cases.
       ADD WORD   "this will convert the word to lower case.
       ADD word (PROP) "this will save the word as a proper noun.
       ADD Word        "this also adds word as a proper noun.
       ADD word (CAPS) "this adds the word in all upper case.
       ADD WoRd        "any other combination will be added as is.
 
o DEL
 
  The DEL command deletes words from the dictionary.  It may
  be used in open and closed forms, just like the ADD command.
  If you try to delete a word not in the dictionary, PROOF
  says nothing, since the word is already gone.  The words are deleted
  in the same way the words are added the options are the same.
 
o LIST
 
  The LIST command lists part or all of the dictionary.  Its
  format is
 
    LIST [word1[ - word2]][ ON fid] [(COL)]
 
  LIST by itself (no options) is illegal because WEBSTER
  assumes the dictionary file is quite large.  You may say
  LIST ON LP, however, to get a full listing of the dictionary.
  "word1" and "word2" bracket a range of words to be listed.
  Neither must be a word, but "word2" must collate higher than
  "word1", and the hyphen separating them must be surrounded by
  spaces.  If only "word1" is specified, WEBSTER checks for the
  existence of that word.  If you say LIST word1 or LIST word1 -
  word2 and nothing lists, the word(s) does not exist.
  The COL option will list the words in a single column.
 
o END
 
  Returns you to IBEX.
 
.*B*
A "word" is defined in more detail in PROOF_HELP.X.  Briefly,
words may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, hyphens
(-), and single quotes (').  They may not contain any special
characters or spaces; WEBSTER will not let you enter non-words
into the dictionary.  Words are normally entered by the user in
lower case.  If a word is entered in all upper case, it is
changed to all lower case before storing.  If a word is entered
with a leading capital letter followed by all lower case letters,
it is changed to all lower case but a PROP bit is set.  Other
combinations, such as "aAA" or "AaA" will be stored as is.  Words
must contain at least one letter and should not have enclosing
pairs of single quotes (''hi'') or leading or trailing hyphens
(hi-- --there) or two or more consecutive embedded hyphens
(like--this), as these words will never be accessed by PROOF.
 
Typical use of PROOF and WEBSTER dictates that the PROOF_DIC.X
dictionary should be kept "pure"; that is, it contains only good
semi-technical English words that can be found in a dictionary.
Abbreviations should be entered cautiously (such as "etc" or "et
al", which must be entered as two words).  Users may then use
WEBSTER to build an alternate dictionary that contains
"words" they normally find in their "documents" which they
accept as correctly spelled.  For example, when using PROOF on
an error message file it is convenient to define an alternate
dictionary containing "U1", "U2", and "U3" as words, among others,
to shorten the proofreading listing (note that the "%" must be
stripped off since it is a special character).  To use this
alternate dictionary the user invokes PROOF by typing
 
    !PROOF.X source,dictionary
 
PROOF will use BOTH the alternate dictionary and PROOF_DIC.X to
proofread the "source" file.  Other combinations are allowed;
see PROOF_HELP.X for details.

.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
01/16/90 Restored the ability to use the same special characters (#$%_@)
         that PROOF.X treats as alphabetic in WEBSTER words. (JES)
         Also removed unprintable characters from LIST output and
         changed to treat blank lines the same as null lines.
.*B*
06/26/89 Restored (and documented) the facility to allow the command
         stream to be redirected via DCB#2.  (JES)
.*R*
09/20/88 Almost completly rewritten WEBSTER now has X$PARSE routine
         calls and adheres to the new storage technique.  (JAW)
.*R*
02/29/88 Fixed WEBSTER so that it won't issue M$PROMPT unless it
         needs to. (JLJ)
.*R*
05/27/83 Fixed open checking code to allow for updating if UPD or
         WNEW or DELR is set after open
.*R*
05/27/83 Fixed auto-update code for a new account
.*R*
10/15/82 Fixed a bug in the ADD code which caused words to be
         inserted in the wrong case in the dictionary.
.*R*
10/15/82 Changed the default to PROOF_DIC.X rather than
         PROOF_DIC.<current FMA>.
.*R*
10/15/82 Added logic to catch a CP-6 bug which doesn't ALTRET
         on OPEN UPDATE even if the user can't update the file.
.*R*
10/15/82 Eliminated the "Sorry can't do that" message and added
         the system error message instead.
.*R*
08/16/82 - Fixed a bug which caused LIST without a range to start at a
           random point in the file.
