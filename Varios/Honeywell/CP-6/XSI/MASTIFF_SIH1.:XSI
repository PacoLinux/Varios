MASTIFF - Munge Anlz_STar InFormation File, parses a set of commands and
created a keyed version of ANLZ_STAR for ANLZ to read during the STAR command.
.*B*
Invocation: !MASTIFF.X sifid {TO|ON|OVER|INTO} oufid
 
where sifid is the input file
      oufid is the output ANLZ_STAR file.
 
Diagnostics are printed through M$DO.
.*K* SYNTAX
Syntax for MASTIFF source records is:
 
      {:HOST}
      {:FEP } = string of ANLZ commands separated by semicolons
      {fcg  }
 
 :HOST specifes the default commands for host dumps.
 :FEP specified the default commands for fep dumps.
 fcg specifies the default commands for dumps with a screech code
      of 'fcg'.  Note this may be 2 or 3 letters.  ANLZ will first
      try to match the 3 char fcg-mid from the screech code to
      a record in ANLZ_STAR, if that fails, it will try using
      just the first two char fcg, if that fails, it will use
      the commands from the default HOST or FEP record, whichever
      is appropriate.
