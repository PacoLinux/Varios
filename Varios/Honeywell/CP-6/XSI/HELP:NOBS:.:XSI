NOBS is a tool to eat a TEXT input file and change backspaced/underscored
passages into a format compatible with CP-6 FEP input functioning.
Full command line syntax:
 
!NOBS.X text_file
 
where:
text_file is a TEXT input file containing TEXT directives
NOBS examines the input file, and will take overstruck sequences (created by
backspacing and underscoring, for example) and make sure that no
backspace/space sequences occur, no space/backspace sequences occur, and that
passages are underscored BEFORE the text, allowing the text to be read on a
CRT.  NOBS always keys its output (text_file).   NOBS uses no scratch files,
reading and writing the file specified by text_file (M$SI).  Diagnostics are
written through M$DO.
NOBS has proven particularly useful in these instances:
a) Importing converted TEXT files from CP-V.
b) As an aid in importing TEXT-like files from alien environments (like UNIX).
c) Removing excess BS/SP or SP/BS sequences from text documents, since CP-6
TEXT (through version B02) only overstrikes an existing line once prior to
printing it.  Excess SP/BS sequences can sometimes mean that what the typist
wanted in that column will not be printed by TEXT.
No more help is available for NOBS.
