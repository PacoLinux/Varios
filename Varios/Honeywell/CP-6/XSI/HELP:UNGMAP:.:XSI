UNGMAP takes an object unit, and produces an assembly listing.
UNGMAP is called in the following manner:
 
     !UNGMAP.X fid [{TO|OVER} ,lofid] [(option[,...])]
     "fid" is the name of the file to be dis-assembled.  If no
     fid is specified, UNGMAP will prompt, expecting a object
     module (not a name, but an actual module) from the keyboard
     (Good luck!).  "lofid" is the name of the listing output
     file.
 
See the OPTIONS, CHANGES, and/or OWNER topics for further information.

New compiler types (PARTRGE and IDL) are now supported;  all compiler names
are now printed in full (e.g. "FORTRAN") rather than as 4-character
abbreviations (e.g. "FORT").
 
In the LO(DATA) dump, relocations using well-known segment IDs are now
interpreted in numeric form.  For example:  a location which contains a
pointer represending ADDR(NIL) now appears as "000000 006014" rather than
as "000000 000000".  Segments IDs which are interpreted in this fashion
include the instruction segment, read-only segment, null segment, JIT,
and all 8 user data segments.

Changes implemented over the past few months include:
 
-  NLO option now works.
-  Output lines which are wider than the width of the output device
   are compressed;  nonblank portions are shifted left as much as
   necessary.
-  New statement types are supported.
-  If you tell UNGMAP to interpret a file which isn't an OU, UNGMAP
   will tell you so rather than M$ERR'ing.
