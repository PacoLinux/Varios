SYNOPSIS:

.*R*
COMPRESS.X [ -cdfivV ] [-b bits] [file ...]
.*
.fin
.*R*
 
DESCRIPTION:
 
COMPRESS.X compresses the specified files or standard input.  Each
file is replaced by a file with the extension :Z, but only if the
file got smaller.  If no files are specified, the compression is
applied to the standard input and is written to the standard output
regardless of the results.  Compressed files can be restored to
their original state by specifying the -d option on the :Z files
or the standard input.  The -c option causes the results of the
compress/decompress operation to be written to stdout with no files
changed.  This is useful because the original files are not deleted,
therefore verification of the compression/decompression can be made.

.*K*IMPLEMENTATION
COMPRESS uses the modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm described in
.*
.fin
.*R*
      "A Technique for High Performance Data Compression"
      Terry A. Welch
      "IEEE Computer" Volume 17, No 6 (June 1984), pp8-19.

Common substrings in the file are first replaced by 9-bit codes 257
and up.  When code 512 is reached, the algorithm switches to 10-bit
codes and continues to use more bits until the bits limit as specified
by -b flag is reached (default 16).  After the bits limit is reached
compress periodically checks the compression ratio.  If it is
increasing, compress contniues to use the codes that were previously
found in the file.  However if the compression ratio decreases,
compress discards the table of substrings and rebuilds it from
scratch.  This allows the algorithm to adapt to the next "block" of
the file.
.*B*
A two byte magic number is prepended to the file to ensure that
neither decompression of random text nor recompression of
compressed text are attempted.  In addition, the bits specified
during compressionis written to the file so that the -b flag can
be omitted for decompression.
 
The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input
file, the amount of bits per code, and the distribution of
character substrings.  Typically, text files, such as C programs,
are reduced by 50-60%.
.*K* BUGS
Files compressed on large machines with more bits than allowed on a
version of compress on a smaller machine cannot be decompressed.
