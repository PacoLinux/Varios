ALPINE - Creates an alphabetical listing of program modules.
.*B*
 Usage:
 
 !ALPINE.X fid {ON|TO|OVER} index_fid[(option[)]]
 
 fid        specifies source file to be indexed by ALPINE
 index_fid  specifies destination of index
 option     specifies language of source file where
 
       P[L6]     indicates PL6 source (this is the default)
       F[ORTRAN] indicates FORTRAN source
 
.*B*
ALPINE is "A Listing and Procedure INdExing tool" used to create an
alphabetical listing of procedures,functions,subroutines,etc. from an input
file identifier.  The index is then created in the index_fid with the fid of
the source preceeding each section of the index.
 
The index created by ALPINE contains the name of the module, its type, e.g.
PROC or FUNCTION, and the key it is located on in the source file.  The index
created from the source file also displays the name of the file with the
account before the module information.  When wildcarding is used, the name of
each file preceeds its module listing.
 
ALPINE currently handles only source from PL6 and FORTRAN because they have
easily identified keywords for ALPINE to search for.  If no language is
specified in the option, PL6 is assumed.  If no information is found in a file
matching the appropriate language, no output is generated.
 
NOTE: ALPINE may not work properly for source files that have not been compiled
without errors.

Creates an alphabetical listing of program modules and their record numbers

.*K* EXAMPLES
An example of ALPINE using a FORTRAN file containing several functions and
subroutines follows:
 
      !ALPINE.X TESTFILE OVER INDEX_TESTFILE(FORTRAN)
 
might create an index in INDEX_TESTFILE as follows:
.*R*
 
 
   FILE: TESTFILE                       ACCOUNT: MYACCOUN
 
    KEY        ROUTINE TYPE   ROUTINE NAME
    ---        ------------   ------------
    34.000 ..... SUBROUTINE ....CHECKTEST
    99.200 ..... SUBROUTINE ....CLOSEFILE
   320.100 ..... FUNCTION ......ERROR_MESS
    67.000 ..... FUNCTION ......OPENFILE
   224.000 ..... SUBROUTINE ....SEARCH_INPUT
     1.000 ..... PROGRAM .......TESTFILE
