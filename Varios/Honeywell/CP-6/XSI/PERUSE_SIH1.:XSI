FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
PERUSE searches for words in PROOF.X dictionaries.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!PERUSE.X [word] [,dictionary]  [ (  SUG[GEST] , COL[UMNS]=nnn , L[ENGTH] )
 
where:
 
word is a word to be looked up in the dictionary.  word may be a string with
one or more imbedded wildcard characters ('?').  word cannot exceed 31
characters in length.
 
dictionary specifies a PROOF.X dictionary to search. Default is PROOF_DIC.X.
 
SUG/GEST says that PERUSE should take the given word and attempt to suggest a
correct spelling.  Wildcarding is not allowed if SUGGEST is used.
 
COL/UMNS=nnn  specifies a "platen width" for output.  Default is 80.  Range is
10 - 132.  If a value from 0 - 10 is supplied, a single-column list is made.
 
L/ENGTH says that PERUSE should treat wildcards as a single letter wild card
with the length of the pattern being the same as the words found.
 
.*B*
PERUSE will find and print all words found in the dictionary (PROOF_DIC.X)
matching the input string.  PERUSE prints its word list many words to an
80-character line, in 10-column widths.  Output is through F$108, including
error messages.
