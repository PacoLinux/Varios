CP6DEARC.X will "unpack" a packed file (created by CP6ARC.X) back into its
respective individual files.
.*B*
Command syntax:
 
    !CP6DEARC.X fid1 TO/ON/OVER .acct[(options)]
 
where:
 
fid1 - the "packed" file or input file which was packaged together by CP6ARC.X.
See HELP (CP6ARC.X) for more packing information.
 
acct - the account where you wish the unpacked files to be located.
 
options is one or more of the following:
 
L/IST - lists the file(s) in a similar format as the PCL list command.
 
F/ILE=fid1  or  F/ILE=(fid1,fid2,..) - this option tells CP6DEARC which files
are to be "extracted" from the packed file.
 
STD=fid  -  this option tells CP6DEARC there's a file which contains a list of
files to unpack only.
 
.*B*
 
CP6DEARC.X will pull files out of the packaged file produced by CP6ARC.X, and
unpack the files back into their original forms.  Keyed files will unpack into
keyed files, and consecutive files will unpack into consecutive files.
 
.*B*
 
EXAMPLE:
 
    !CP6DEARC.X BOOK OVER .X(STD=file_w_files)
 
This command will pick up the list of filenames from the file file_w_files, and
unpack the list of files from BOOK, and put the unpacked files in the X
account.
 
    !CP6DEARC.X BOOK TO .X(FILE=only_one)
 
This command will unpack the file named only_one from the file BOOK and put the
unpacked file in the X account.
 
Hit '?' for more examples.
.*B*
 
    !CP6DEARC.X BOOK ON .X(FILE=(first_one,second_one))
 
This command will pull the two files given in the FILE option, and put them in
the X account.  NOTE: If more than one file is specified in the FILE option,
the list of files needs to be enclosed in '(' and ')'.
 
    !CP6DEARC.X BOOK OVER .X(LIST,FILE=one_fid)
 
This command will look for the file named one_fid in BOOK and will only list
the file (like a PCL list), but will not unpack the file.
 
    !CP6DEARC.X BOOK TO .X(LIST)
 
This command will list every file in the BOOK, but will not unpack them.  In
other words, the files will not get unpacked into the X account.
