RAM (the Registered Account Mover) creates SUPER JCL to establish an logon's
owner based on the registration info maintained by MAIL.
.*B*
Invocation syntax is:
 !RAM.X
 
RAM can only be run by a user who has read access to :USERS.:SYS and
:NAME.:MAIL.
.*B*
RAM creates a file in the running account called $SUPER_REG_NAME.  This file
contains all the JCL to set the account owner field for any account that is
registered with MAIL.  The DCB that RAM writes this file through is M$RN (for
Registered Name).  After RAM is used, GOAT.X is used to look at the account
owner fields.
