COMMANDFP2 is the TP Command Forms Program rewritten from FPL to PL-6.
COMMANDFP2 runs with CRT's only (No HARDCOPY devices).
COMMANDFP2 functions in the same manner as COMMAND_FP; TPA commands are sent to
TPA, and messages reported by TPA are displayed on the screen.  COMMANDFP2 uses
the macros in Q_MACRO_C.:LIBRARY (Q_FPABT, Q_MESSAGE, Q_COMMAND to be specific)
for formatting messages sent to and from TPA and COMMANDFP2.
 
COMMANDFP2 allows the use of windows.  The original COMMAND_FP located in .:SYS
was written in FPL and has a hardcoded window of 20 lines down by 80 columns
wide; COMMANDFP2 requires a minimum of 30 columns wide by about 6 lines down.
 
COMMANDFP2 will not work for hardcopy forms.  A determination is made at the
startup of this program whether or not the device is hardcopy; an M$EXIT is
issued logging the device off if the device is indeed hardcopy.

Installed in LADC X account.
It is recommended that COMMANDFP2 be installed in :SYS under a different name
than COMMAND_FP; thus keeping the original COMMAND_FP in place.  There is a new
parameter in TPA:  LET CFPRU command_fp_name which allows you to set the
command forms program name at startup.
 
TPA must have read access to COMMANDFP2, so modify the file in
.:SYS as follows:
 
    !MOD COMMANDFP2.:SYS TO (ACS+((TPA),READ))
