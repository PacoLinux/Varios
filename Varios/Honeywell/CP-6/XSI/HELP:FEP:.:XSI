FEP.:SYS is a processor that tells you which FEPs are up, when they came up,
and provides information about active channels.
Command line syntax:
 
 !FEP.:SYS [fep#,fep#,fep#,....]
 
FEP may also be installed in :SYS, where the command line syntax is:
 
 !FEP [fep#, fep#, fep#, ...]
Some examples:
 
    !FEP.:SYS
 
    !FEP.:SYS 1,2
 
    !FEP.:SYS 12
 
The display will show you the FEP number, hex channel number, the subdevice
number (if any), the subsubdevice number (if any), the type of channel, the
accounting name of the entity and the usage.  If a sync device, the internal id
will be shown in brackets; if a TP device, the instance name will be shown in
brackets.
 
If FEP is invoked out of the X account then the user must have the FMR
privilege.
 
If the processor is invoked out of :SYS then any user can obtain the
information.

10/11/90 - PAR.  Fixed display of channel 0 (from TCP/IP machines).
870820 JLJ
Fixed the "bug" where the time reported for when the FEP logged on was actually
the time the first or last device in the "to be reported" list logged on.
Instead, it now searches for the "oldest" device in the list, and reports that
as the "FEP logon time".  That may not be 100% accurate, but it's better.
850811 JLJ
Fixed up to print reasonable things about how the devices are attached.  Made
subdevices and subsubdevices work.  Added FEP # to display.  Added TP instance
id and/or device name/number to display.
