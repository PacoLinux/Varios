FCG_DATA (Functional Code Group _DATA file) is a data base file that
FCG.X opens by default.  This is a seperately maintained "tool".
There is no command line syntax for this "tool".  For further details
see !HELP (FCG.X).

FCG.X depends on having a data file to operate properly.
 
FCG_DATA.X is the default, and must be maintained as a seperate X
account "tool".  It has its own help file and everything.
 
   !HELP (FCG.X)  for further info
 
FCG_DATA is based on AF71 (AF_0071J-3 when this version was
completed).  Thus, FCG should have it's data file, FCG_DATA.X,
modified when this Arch File is changed in any way.

The messages in the FCG_DATA file are entered and kept up to date in
a manual fashion.  Messages may be added or modified by a simple
"plus-packet" in the usual X account update procedures.
 
The file has a simple structure to it, as follows:
 
fcg backwards_link control_acct"message"
 
  where:
   fcg            is a FCG of the form XYZ
   backwards_link is a "processor" name or area of code
   control_acct   is the CP-6 Control account where the source lives
                  (this field is not presently used, but must exist)
   message        is the data output back to the user
 
An fcg would be of the form:
   A__ $BOGUS$ $NOACCT$ Authorization and Accounting
   AS_ SUPER   :E02SI   SUPER - device and form...
   ASA $BOGUS$ $NOACCT$ The "A" module level description of SUPER here
    o
    o
    o
   ASZ $BOGUS$ $NOACCT$ The "Z" module level description of SUPER here
 
   B__ ... etc
 
The "_" (under score) in the fcg is a control character, that tell us
what level of message this is to be.
 
The "$BOGUS$" keyword is used to say that we do not have a backwards link
for this particular message.  The links tend to go with the XY_ type fcgs,
so the $BOGUS$ would be used on all others.
 
The "$NOACCT$" keyword tells us that we do not need an account for this
level of message.  Similar to the BOGUS keyword, this account is usually
only specified for the XY_ level of fcg.
