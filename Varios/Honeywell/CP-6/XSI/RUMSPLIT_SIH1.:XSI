RUMSPLIT takes a file containing RUM directives and splits it into
smaller files, each containing a single product's RUMs.
 
To use:
!RUMSPLIT.X ::RUM.:SYS OVER prefix.account [ (procname) ]
 
The file ::RUM.:SYS (for example) will then be split up into several
files in .account, each file name being of the form:
 
prefixproductnameyymmdd
 
where
productname is the rununit name as given on the RUM directive
and
yymmdd      is the yymmdd of the uts of the rununit, as given on the RUM
               directive
 
If the optional  (procname) is specified, then only an extract of the
RUMs for procname will be performed.  If it is not specified, then all
procnames encountered will be extracted.

.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
03/17/89 Stop building the OU file when it finds a '!' in column 1.
         This will allow small rum files to be built from JCL
         files containing rums.
