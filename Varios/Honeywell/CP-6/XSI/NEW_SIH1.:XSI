.*K* SUBMITTALS
X account tools can be submitted by the CP-6 user community.  If you have a
tool that you think measures up to (or exceeds) X account expectations, make
sure it fits the X account naming conventions, and fire off a copy of it on a
CP-6 labelled tape to:
 
 John Joseph
 Bull HN Information Systems Inc.
 5250 W. Century Blvd. Room 241
 Los Angeles, Ca 90045
 
 Attn: X account submittals
 
DO NOT SEND TO LADC SOFTWARE LIBRARY UNLESS YOU WANT IT TO DISAPPEAR
 
If John can find someone to love and maintain the tool, it will show up in the
X account.
 
Be aware that distribution in the X account requires the addition of the Bull
HN copyright notice.  If you are not prepared to yield your copyright claims,
DO NOT SEND YOUR TOOL.

John also maintains the LADC DEMO account, if you've got submittals for that.

Some tools are better/best if installed in :SYS.  At LADC, we copy the
following tools and their HELP files to :SYS.  More often than not, special
access controls are added to the tools so that they won't fall into the wrong
hands.
