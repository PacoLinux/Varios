REWRAP is a tool which "rewraps" JCL or PCL files that use a semicolon for
continuation into single records.
Syntax:
 
    !REWRAP.X input_file {ON|INTO|OVER} output_file [(option)]
 
where "input_file" contains the text to be unwrapped.  DCB1 is used to read the
text source, and DCB3 is used for the unwrapped results.  "input_file" may be
the same as "output_file".
 
Options are:
 
LEN/GTH=xxx    determines maximun length of output records.  Range
               of xxx is 72 - 255.
For example, let's say you've got an IBEX command file that someone used to
update all the time and therefore everything's broken out into individual
records.
 
!FORTRAN ;
     some_file ;
               OVER;
     some_other_file ;
     (NLS)
 
So, you run it through REWRAP and lo!
 
!FORTRAN some_file OVER some_other_file (NLS)
 
Another use some people have found for REWRAP is to effectively build tables or
INIT statements for programs.
 
Lets say you have the values you want for a PL-6 data array in a file:
 
 105
 2010
 65535
  .
  .
 (plus 50 other values)
  .
  .  You can use EDIT on this file, like so:
 
SE;/ /s/,;/
 
so that every number is followed by a ,;
 
Now, when you run it through REWRAP...it looks like:
 
105, 2010, 65535, .... (and 50 other values) ...
 
HINT! DON'T USE THIS PROGRAM ON ANY PL-6 OR PL/I CODE YOU CARE ABOUT!
Hmmmm....no more HELP available for REWRAP.X.  Try the TOPICS.

Updated to change exit message.

Made changes necessary to allow 255 character input and writing 255 character
records on output.  LEN=255 is now legal.
