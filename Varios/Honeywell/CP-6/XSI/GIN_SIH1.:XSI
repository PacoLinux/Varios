FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of

.*A*
GIN displays or changes attributes of existing run units.
.*B*
GIN is used to update an existing run unit and change many of the values that
were specified when the RU was linked.  It does not affect the location or
structure of procedure, data or overlay information.  It does let you change
privilege bits, run unit attributes, DCB positions, shared library names,
alternate shared library names and increase existant patch space.
 
GIN will also let you display the attributes in an existing run unit.  You do
not need to be able to update the run unit to use this feature.
 
For a specific list of the facilities handled by GIN type:
    HELP COMMANDS
 
.*K* INVOKING
The syntax for invoking GIN is:
 
    !GIN.X ru_fid [(commands[,...][)]]
 
If the optional command list is present, GIN is invoked as a one shot process
and exits when the commands have been processed.  If the command list is
omitted, GIN will prompt for successive commands against the ru_fid.
 
.*K* COMMANDS
XUG commands:
 
    ! ?, ??, DATE, DIRECTORY, DO, END, ERASE, HELP, XIT, QUIT
 
LINK originating commands:
 
    ALTSHARELIB, DCB, DCBSLOTS, DPATCH, IPATCH, LAUTO, LODCB,
    N, NDCB, NOALTSHARELIB, NOCHGPMEM, NOSHARELIB, NSHAREABLE,
    OUDCB, PRIVILEGES, PROCACC, SHAREABLE, SHARELIB, SIDCB,
    SLOCK, STDINVOC, SURCHARGE, TCB, UIDCB, WLOCK
 
Alternate syntax for LINK commands:
 
    #1, #2, #3, #4, N#1, N#2, N#3, N#4
 
GIN specific commands:
 
    DI, DPATCH, FLAVOR, IPATCH, KEEP, PRIMARY, PATCH, PSEUDOFLAVOR,
    REMOVE, REPLACE, SECONDARY
 
.*B*
Commands are divided into three major categories.  The first category are the
display commands.  These can be used to display various values from within the
run unit.  Everything that can be updated by this tool can be displayed using
this command.  All of these commands begin with DISPLAY.  (See HELP DISPLAY for
more information.)
 
.*B*
The second category are the commands used for updating the run unit.
Most of these commands come from the options that can be specified when
performing a LINK.  As much as possible the same syntax and abbreviations has
been kept for these commands.  Some additions have been made to provided for
compatibility with other tools.  For example #1 is synonymous with DCB1.
 
.*B*
The final category consists of only one command.  This is the PSEUDOFLAVOR
command which allows you to specify how to treat this run unit if it has a
flavor other than HOST or FEP.
 
.*K* DPATCH
    DP[ATCH]
 
.*B*
Enlarges the data patch space a maximum of 1 page per invocation.
 
.*K* XUG_COMMANDS
It is assumed that you know XUG commands.
 
.*K* LINK_COMMANDS
For LINK compatible commands say:
    HELP (LINK) OPTIONS option-name
 
.*K* # #1 #2 #3 #4
# is a synonym for the prefix DCB.
 
.*K* N# N#1 N#2 N#3 N#4
N# is a synonym for the prefix NDCB.
 
.*K* FLAVOR
    FL[AVOR] = { 'HOST' | 'FEP' | integer }
 
.*B*
Changes the actual flavor of the run unit.
 
.*K* IPATCH
    IP[ATCH]
 
.*B*
Enlarges the instruction patch space a maximum of 1 page per invocation.
 
.*K* KEEP
           { ARE[ADEF] }
           { ENT[DEF]  }
    KEE[P] { SEG[DEF]  }  [ ( symbol [, . . .] ) ]
           { SYM[DEF]  }
 
.*B*
Keeps only those definitions of the type specified that were in
the list of symbols.  All others are removed.  Each symbol can
also be a wildcard specification.
 
.*K* PATCHS
    PA[TCHS]
 
.*B*
Enlarges both then data and instruction patch spaces a maximum of 1 page
for each patch space per invocation.
.*K* PRIMARY
PRIM[ARY] ENT[DEF] ( symbol [, . . . ] )
 
.*B*
Marks the symbol as a primary ENTDEF.  Each symbol can also be a
wildcard specification.
 
.*K* PSEUDOFLAVOR
    PSE[UDOFLAVOR] = { 'HOST' | 'FEP' }
 
.*B*
Tells GIN to make believe the run unit is of this flavor so GIN knows what the
format of the file is.
 
.*K* REMOVE
             { ARE[ADEF] }
             { ENT[DEF]  }
    REM[OVE] { SEG[DEF]  }  [ ( symbol [, . . .] ) ]
             { SYM[DEF]  }
 
.*B*
Removes definitions of the type specified that were in
the list of symbols.  Each symbol can also be a wildcard
specification.
 
.*K* REPLACE
              { ARE[ADEF] }
              { ENT[DEF]  }
    REP[LACE] { SEG[DEF]  }  [ ( symbol [, . . .] ) ]
              { SYM[DEF]  }
 
.*B*
Replaces definitions of the type specified that were in
the list of symbols.  Each symbol can also be a wildcard
specification.
 
.*K* SECONDARY
SEC[ONDARY] ENT[DEF] ( symbol [, . . . ] )
 
.*B*
Marks the symbol as a secondary ENTDEF.  Each symbol can also be a
wildcard specification.  This has the most use for the FORTRAN
and COBOL library which have a primary ENTDEF in data.  To
facilitate debugging you want to remove these ENTDEF's.
For FORTRAN remove:
    .XPT_8TO_D
For COBOL remove:
    .CDBUG

.*B*
The DISPLAY command allows you to display various attributes of a run unit.
You can display information in run units even if you cannot update them.
