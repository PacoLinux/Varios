PRIVWARN displays the account, name, sysid, user number, and CCBUF of
running users who have the specified privileges set.  A "!" will appear
before CCBUF if the user is at job step.
To use:
 
!PRIV SPCLMM
!PRIVWARN.X {ON|OVER|INTO} ,listout [(options)]
 
The "options" may be a combination of privilege types, privileges,
processor privileges, and a user identifier.
 
The user identifier can select one user based on his sysid "n":
   SYSID=n
 
Specifiable privilege types are:
   PPRIV, ACTIVE, AUTH, JOB, PRC, SAVED
 
Specifiable privileges are:
   FMEFT, FLBLK, FMSEC, FMDIAG, FMREAD, DISPJOB, SYSCON, ASAVE, GPP,
   SYSLOG, MFEP, CFEP, IOQW, IOQ, EXPM, PM, TND, JIT, MSYS, MAXMEM,
   EXMM, SPCLMM, SNAP, SCREECH, CQ, INTCON
 
Specifiable processor privileges are:
   CNTRLD, CNTRLC, EFT, EL, LABEL, PIGD, PIGC, SPIDERD, SPIDERC, SUPER,
   NETCON, SUPERAUTH, SUPERWSN, SUPERFORM, PADMIN, SUPERD, VOLINIT,
   REPLAY, RATES, SYSCON
If no options are specified, all AUTH privileges are assumed.  If
privileges are specified without specifying a privilege type,
ACTIVE is assumed.  If processor privileges are specified without
specifying a privilege type, PPRIV is assumed.  If a privilege type
is specified without specifying any privileges, the "current"
privileges are assumed.  The "current" privileges are those last
specified, or all if none have been specified.
 
Privileges and processor privileges are handled independently.
Examples:
(ACTIVE,AUTH,JOB)
   display users who have any ACTIVE, AUTH, or JOB privileges
(ACTIVE(FMSEC),AUTH,JOB)
   display users who have FMSEC privilege ACTIVE, AUTH, or JOB
(FMSEC)

   and reset these
