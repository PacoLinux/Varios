STI_PRODUCT.X is a keyed file that STI.X can use to get the proper product name
and marketing ID for any file that it is processing.  STI_PRODUCT is built by
STI.X from a source file (STI_PRODUCT_SIC1) that consists of comments, product
records, and filename records.  Comments start with a double-quote, not
necessarily in column one.  Product records start with a marketing id in column
one, and continue with a product name in column fifteen.  The product name
field is limited to 24 characters.  Filename records follow the product record
and consist of one or more blanks followed by a single filename.  Any number of
filename records can follow the corresponding product record.  All filenames
must, however, be unique.
