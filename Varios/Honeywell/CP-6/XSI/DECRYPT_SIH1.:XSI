DECRYPT allows you to de-encrypt your ENCRYPT.X files with a 72-bit
         (8 character)  key.
.*B*
 
DECRYPT is a block mode dencryption program that decrypts ciphertext in
72-bit blocks, using a 72-bit key. The algorithm used for encryption is
vaugely similar to the DES algorithm.
 
.*B*
How to use:
 
  !DECRYPT.X source-file (ON|OVER|TO) destination
  *decryption seed
 
Examples:
 
  !DECRYPT.X SALES-REPORT OVER SALES_REPORT
  *36-24-26
 
  !DECRYPT.X SALES-REPORT OVER SALES_REPORT
  *HELLO DOLLY    "file has been doubly decrypted
