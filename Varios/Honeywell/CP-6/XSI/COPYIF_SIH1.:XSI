COPYIF is a tool used to maintain "common accounts".  It executes a specific
PCL command if the "source" file is newer than the "destination" file or if the
destination file does not yet exist.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
 !COPYIF.X source_fid, destination_fid [(pcl command)]
 
 or
 
 !COPYIF.X source_fid, destination_fid
 pcl command1
 pcl command2
     .
     .
     .
 pcl commandN
 
where:
 
source_fid is the fid of the file to be copied
 
destination_fid is the fid of the file to be copied OVER/INTO/TO/ON.
 
pcl_command is any valid command to be passed to PCL.
 
.*B*
The primary use of COPYIF is to avoid copying the same version of a file over
itself. COPYIF will only pass the command (usually a C[OPY]) to PCL if the
destination file does not exist or is older than the source file.
.*B*
EXAMPLE:
 
!COPYIF.X GOPHER.:XSI, GOPHER.X (C GOPHER.:XSI OVER GOPHER.X(ACC(?,EXEC))
 
If the GOPHER file in .:XSI is newer than the GOPHER file in .X, OR GOPHER.X
does not exist, then:
 
 C GOPHER.:XSI OVER GOPHER.X(ACC(?,EXEC))
 
will be sent to PCL for execution.
 
  BUT...
 
If the GOPHER file in .:XSI is older OR the same age as the GOPHER file in .X,
the command will not be executed.
.*B*
Since COPYIF is intended to maintain "common accounts", the presumption is made
that the source file exists.  If for some reason (like packset not mounted)
that the source file cannot be found, COPYIF will exit with STEPCC=2.  This
will normally make batch or XEQ files abort, but you can (and should) make XEQ
files look something like this:
 
!COPYIF.X A.X,A.:SYS (CA A.X OVER .:SYS)
.*R*
!IF STEPCC>0 THEN M ....HELP! A.X didn't exist! Tell someone!
.*R*
!IF STEPCC>0 THEN LET STEPCC=0
