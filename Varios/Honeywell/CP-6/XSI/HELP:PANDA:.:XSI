PANDA is the Packset ANalyzer for Disk Addresses.  It identifies how one or
more disk addresses are used on a disk pack, for use in diagnosing disk drive
problems.
Command line syntax:
 
  !PANDA.X
 
Two basic functions are provided by commands to PANDA:
 
DISPLAY addressing information relative to the logical sections that exist on
one or more disk devices.
 
          DISPLAY [device_list]
 
SEARCH a particular device for one or more supplied disk addresses and identify
how those addresses are used.
 
          S[EARCH] DPnn [[WITH] SUM[MARY]]
 
PANDA must be installed in :SYS or you must be authorized for SPCLMM and FMDIAG
privileges (for the DISPLAY command) and have FMSEC as well (if you wish to use
the SEARCH command).

Changes made to facilitate the Mirrored Disk capability in E03.  Also, disk
addresses should be accepted both in the format CCC-HH-SS and as a device
logical address (DLA), i.e., a device relative granule number.

PANDA was looping when a deleted account directory was encountered per star
#41017.
02/08/91
Messages output by PANDA did not accomodate 4 digit cylinders as described in
star #40687.
Link PANDA with privileges FMDIAG, SPCLMM and FMS so that it may be run from
:SYS per #40387.

Allow a 4 digit cylinder number to be specified per star #39569.  Also, changes
made to utilize the proper segment, DVTTBLSID, to access the DVT tables.

Syntax : D[ISPLAY] [device_list]
 
where:
 
device_list
     is a list of one or more disk device names of the form DPnn, each
separated by a comma.  If no device_list is supplied, all devices are listed.
The command displays the following information for each device requested :
 
VSN
     the volume serial number and section identifier (i.e., A for section 1, B
for section 2, ...) for each logical section that is on the device.
 
PACKSET-nn
     the packset to which each section is part.  If the section is part of a
packset, then nn will identify what volume number this section is.  If the
section is not part of any packset, it is considered to be 'available'.
 
SIZE
     the size in granules of each section.
 
1st and LAST
     the starting and ending disk adresses are provided in two DISK ADDRESSES
formats:  CCC-HH-SS, the cylinder, track and sector number, and as a device
relative granule number.

where
 
WITH SUMMARY
     requests a summary of which granules were checked
 
DPnn
     identifies which disk device to search.  The user will then be prompted
for as many as 32 disk addresses by the prompt :
 
  Enter addresses as CCCC-HH-SS or as device relative granule number(DLA).
 
      Address>>
 
where CCCC specifies the cylinder number,
        HH specifies the track or head number and
        SS specifies the sector number.
 
      DLA is the device logical address, i.e., the device relative
          granule number.
 
A null response, E[ND] or Q[UIT] will terminate requests for disk addresses and
initiate the search.
The following checks are made for each of the disk addresses entered and an
appropriate message is output if any of the check is successful :
 
1.  Are the addresses within any of the available sections of the pack?
2.  Are the addresses part of any VID, granule pool, PAD, MAD or file directory
of any of the pack set sections of the device?
3.  Are the addresses part of any free granule of the pack set sections of the
device?
4.  Are the addresses part of any file that resides on the pack?
