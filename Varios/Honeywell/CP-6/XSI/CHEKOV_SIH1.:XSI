FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
CHEKOV turns off the "check altret/argument count" flag on all entry points in
an object unit.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!CHEKOV.X object_file
 
where:
 
object_file is a file containing an object unit.  A LEMUR library can be used
as well.
.*B*
CHEKOV has very limited utility.  It is primarily used to strip the CHECK flags
from LADC-created LEMUR libraries where the argument count checking feature is
undesireable.
