CF2VFC converts a PC-style "continuous form" printer file to use CP-6 VFC.
CF2VFC runs under MS-DOS 2.1 or later.
CF2VFC.X must be transferred to your PC using KERMIT or some similar file
transfer mechanism.  It must be named CF2VFC.EXE on your machine.
 
Full command line syntax:  Syntax:  cf2vfc [options] [input-file [output-file]]
 
The input and output files default to stdin and stdout, respectively.  Options
may be concatenated.
 
Example: cf2vfc /fgnoi-8u$ file.d1 file.d2
 
Legal options are:
 
/Bnn /D /G /H /I[-]nn /Lnn /O /K /S /Tnn /Uc
 
More complete option descriptions follow.
Legal Options Are:
 
/Bnn
     Set Bottom Margin to nn lines.
/D
     Don't delete the output file when the program terminates abnormally.
/G
     Translate IBM line graphics to '|', '-', '+' and '='.
/H,/?
     HELP summary.
/I[[-][nn]]
     Indent [-]nn spaces.
/Lnn
     Page length.
/N
     Don't optimize VFC.  No VFC optimizations other than top of form and
deleting blank lines at the end of a page will be done.
/O
     Overwrite output-file if it already exists.
/K
     Remove overstrikes according to the following priorities:
   1.  the leftmost character in the record has the highest priority, all other
things being equal
   2.  alphanumeric
   3.  printable ascii
   4.  if both are unprintable either the '#' character or the character
specified in the /U option is used.
/S
     Scan the input file to determine the maximum output line length (not
including the VFC character) and safe undent value.  No output file will be
created.  However, a summary report for the input and output files will be
produced.  The K, N, B, L and T options will affect the summary report for the
output file.
/Tnn
     Set Top Margin to nn lines.
/Uc
     Translate unprintable characters to c.  Note that if a blank is desired
this must be the last option.

Fixed a problem with tab conversion, changed the copyright notice and compiled
under the Microsoft(tm) C Compiler v5.10.

Added the /D option to allow the user to specify that output files shouldn't be
deleted when CF2VFC terminates abnormally.  Added some better interrupt
handling.
        <CTRL-BREAK> will cause the program to display its current status.
        <CTRL-C> will cause the program to display its current status and
                 then abort.  Note that <CTRL-C> processing may be disabled
                 by the MS-DOS command    "break off".
880815
Added <Ctrl-C> handling, I/O error handling and did some minor cleanup.
880210
Added cdecl to function prototypes and cleaned up the include files.
