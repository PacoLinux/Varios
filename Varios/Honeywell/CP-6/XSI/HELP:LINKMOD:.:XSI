              CP6 LINKMOD  B00 JUL 1988
 
         LINKMOD is a program tool used to alter JCL files containing
LINK-like commands (i.e., command file-list preposition result-file).
The "file-list" portion of each command is searched for any matches with
a supplied list of filenames.  If any are found, the account specification
is altered for each of them, and the altered JCL file is created in the
output account.
All commands and keywords may be abbreviated to the least ambiguous
number of characters except where noted.
*.B*
While searching JCL files, LINKMOD recognizes four commands (LINK,
FEPLINK, COPY, and GLOM) and four prepositions (ON, OVER, TO, and INTO).
All must be entirely uppercase.  The file-list portion must consist only
of "fids", separated by any combination of blanks, commas, parentheses,
and semi-colons, except that when a semi-colon is encountered, the rest
of the line is ignored.
 
Commands    DCBS             Function
-------------------------------------------------------------
GO          NA               Ends setup and begins execution.
IA[cct]     F$LINKSI         Sets JCL input account and file prefix.
OA[cct]     F$LINKOU         Sets the JCL output account.
UA[cct]     NA               Sets the default update account.
LI[st]      F$LIST           Sets the list-file name.
SL          F$SL             Sets the output file for 'SL.X fid' records.
XE[q]       F$SI             Gets commands from a file.
_____________________________________________________________
 
GO                      ( <EOF> or <ESC><F> is the same as GO)
   Ends getting commands from F$SI and begins NXTFing thru the
   the input JCL files, changing accounts of files matching one in the
   list-file and writing any modified JCL files on F$LINKOU.
 
IACCT name[.acct]            (name[.acct] is any legal CP6 fid)
   Sets F$LINKSI to the file name and account specified.
   LINKMOD will modify JCL files whose names match "name?.acct".
 
ie.  *IACCT :LNK.:A00MSC
 
   causes LINKMOD to get all files that start with ':LNK' out
   of the :A00MSC account.
 
OACCT account                 (account is any legal CP6 account)
   Specifies the account where you want modified JCLs to be created.
 
UACCT account                 (account is any legal CP6 account)
   Specifies the default updated account. When LINKMOD finds a file
   in both the JCL file and the list-file, it will change the account
   to UACCT unless the list-file specifies an account for the file,
   which overrides UACCT.  The default for UACCT is the directory account.
 
LIST fid                         ( fid is any legal CP6 file id)
   Specifies the list-file fid.  The list-file contains a list of names
   and optional accounts whose accounts are to be changed in the
   JCL files.  Only one name is used for each record in list-file.
 
SL fid                           ( fid is any legal CP6 file id)
   Specifies a file that is to be created containing 'SL.X run-unit-name'
   for checking purposes. This file will only be created if set via
   the !SET command in IBEX or using the SL command. One SL.X line is
   written to this file for each LINK or FEPLINK command modified in
   the JCL files.
 
XEQ fid                          ( fid is any legal CP6 file id)
   Changes the M$SI Dcb to that file instead of the terminal to get
   commands for LINKMOD.
