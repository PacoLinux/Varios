Syntax: !xxx ...
 xxx = Either, a valid fid to M$LINK to passing 'xxx ...' in CMD
       buffer or a legal IBEX command to be passed to a M$YC
       monitor call.

This command allows you to issue a M$LINK or M$YC from within
RQ. This allows you, for instance, to SPY on a specific user that
is running without exiting RQ.
First, it is assumed that you wish to M$LINK to xxx with 'xxx ...'
passed in the CMD buffer.  If M$LINK ALTRETurns with an error of
'xxx does not exist' then 'xxx ...' is passed to M$YC.  If M$YC
ALTRETurns or M$LINK ALTRETurns with other than the aforementioned
error, then the error is printed and RQ continues.
Example: !
  Say after using RQ to look at the running jobs you were curious
how your own running job was doing and you wanted to SPY on it.
You might issue the following:
  -!SPY A=ZZZLHMAR
No more Help is available for !.
Syntax: A/ll
The A/ll command (equivalent to 'SE/arch A/ll') causes subsequent
queue inquiries to access the Input and Running queue.  This
is what RQ wakes up with as a default.
This will effect what data gets printed on subsequent Find,
Number, Print and/or Tally commands.
No more HELP is available for A/ll.  HELP on F/ind, I/nput,
N/umber, P/rint, R/unning and/or T/ally may be useful.
08/06/85
    Changed references from VLP_TRMATTR.HEIGHT# to VLP_TRMATTR.DSPHEIGHT#.
09/26/84
    Changed references from VLA_JOBSTATS_OSRCH.TNAME to VLA_JOBSTATS_OSRCH.WOD
    so WSN/TNAME/WODs would display as something besides garbage in C00.  Also
    changed the DISPLAY/PRINT of the NUM output field to adjust to six digits
    IF needed (per STAR #18469).  This effect can be negated by issuing a
    'O;F NUM>1000' command instead of a PRINT command.  Also got rid of four
    STATIC arrays and made them dynamic.  This should prevent RQ from Memory
    Faulting when there are more than about 400 items in the output queue.
    A summary line for the TALLY output was also added.
07/09/84
    Made some cosmetic changes to some of the summary messages making
    them easier to spot in a listing.  Also added code that will make RQ
    truncate output through M$LO based upon the value of M$LO->F$DCB.WIDTH#.
    If this value is zero, a value of 132 will be the default.
10/19/82

Subsequent Find or Print commands produce a summary line on ME
of how many items where searched and or listed.  All other
commands produce no output on ME.
This is handy when you are after finding out how many items
satisfy certain criteria but you don't really want to see the
items.
Example: NO
  Say you just BATCHed a job and it is waiting 250 to run.  Being
not to happy about this you wonder what partition(s) your job
qualifies for and how many other jobs qualify for the same
partition.  You could use the following RQ commands:
  -System;All;Find SYsid=your-jobs-sysid
  -Output NO
  -Find PArtition=?partition#?
  -Output ME
    or fully abbreviated:
  -S;A;F SY=your-jobs-sysid
  -NO
  -F PA=?partition#?
  -O ME
    where:
      your-jobs-sysid  is sysid of your BATCHed job
      partition#       is a partition that your job qualifies for
The above will produce a line such as:

I/nput F/ields and/or O/utput F/ields may be useful.

Syntax: R/unning
The Running command (equivalent to 'SE/arch R/unning') causes
subsequent queue inquiries to access the Running queue.

This will effect what data gets printed on subsequent Find, Number,
Print and/or Tally commands.
No more Help is available for R/unning.  Help on A/ll, F/ind,
I/nput, N/umber, O/utput, P/rint, SE/arch and/or T/ally may be

Syntax: SC/an { M/e | A/ll }
  Me  = only your jobs
  All = all jobs (if user is AUTHorized the DISPJOB privilege)
5 lines of Help remain: 3 + 2
SCan controls who's jobs will be considered.  Me means only look
at your own jobs.  All, if user is AUTHorized the DISPJOB
privilege, means look at any jobs or output in the queue.
No more Help is available for SC/an.  Help on M/e and/or S/ystem
may be useful.
Syntax: [SE/arch] { A/ll | I/nput | O/utput | R/unning }

  Input   = Input queue
  Output  = Output queue
  Running = Running queue
8 lines of Help remain: 3 + 3 + 2
SEarch controls which queues will be SEarched.  This will effect
what data gets printed on subsequent Find, Number, Print and/or
Tally commands.
Example: SE/arch
  -SEarch All " This is what RQ wakes up with "
  -SE O       " This is used to look at the Output queue "
No more Help is available for SE/arch.  Help on F/ind,
N/umber, P/rint, SE/arch and/or T/ally may be useful.
Syntax: SI/ze
SI/ze is currently NOT implemented.
No more Help is available for SI/ze.
Syntax: S/ystem
SCan, if user is AUTHorized the DISPJOB privilege, any jobs or
output in the queue.
No more Help is available for S/ystem.  Help on M/e and/or SC/an
may be useful.
Syntax: T/ally [ { .[account] | @[wsn] | form } ]
Gives a Tally of how many jobs or output items per account per
PRIority are in the queue currently being SEarched.
No more Help is available on the T/ally command.  Help on A/ll, I/nput,
O/utput, R/unning, SC/an, SE/arch and/or S/ystem may be useful.
Syntax: X/eq fid
  fid = the fid of a file containing RQ commands.
14 lines of Help remain: 4 + 8 + 2
Causes RQ commands to be read from 'fid'.  If you want RQ to exit
when done reading 'fid', make the last command in 'fid' a E/nd,
Q/uit or X/it.  Otherwise, RQ will prompt the user for more
commands when EOF is hit on 'fid'.
Example: X/eq
  Say you don't like the default fields displayed on the Print
command for the Input queue.  You could set up a Display command
with the fields that you wanted in the order you wanted them.
The following might be put in a file (call it RQ):
  >Di AH,AC,SY,US,A,F,O,MA,M,SP,9T,PA
then to use it, just type:
   -X RQ
No more Help is available for the X/eq command.  For further
help, type 'H;?'.
RQ.X
AID=GENERAL
SYSTEM_INFO
