Splits GCOS source libraries into
separate files.
Command line syntax:
 
!GCOS_SRCLIB.X srclib-file [{ON|OVER|INTO|TO} destination]
 
where:
 
srclib-file is the imported GCOS SRCLIB file to be converted.
 
ON or TO specify that any existing destination files are not to be replaced.
 
OVER specifies that any existing destination files are to be overwritten.  This
is the default.
 
destination specifies the account (and possibly also the packset) where the
converted files are to be written.  The default is the current directory
account.
Source library (SRCLIB) files are used on GCOS by COBOL and other language
processors to hold blocks of statements to be included into the source program.
On CP-6, each of these blocks must be in a separate file.  GCOS_SRCLIB is a
tool to aid in converting applications imported from GCOS to run on CP-6.  It
reads a SRCLIB file (which can be loaded onto a CP-6 system from a GCOS tape
via CAT.X) and creates a separate file for each copy block in the input file.
The names of the output files are the same as the names of the copy blocks in
the input file.  The destination account is specified on the invocation command
line.
