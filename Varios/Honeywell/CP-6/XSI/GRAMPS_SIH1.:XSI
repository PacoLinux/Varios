GRAMPS: GRanule Monitor for Pack Saturation
 
        A way to watch out for saturation of important
        disk packs (like #SYS).
 
.*B*
Intended to be run as a ghost, GRAMPS can help watch out for saturation
of packs. If the monitored pack(s) reach a specified threshold, messages
can be sent to the operator informing him of the problem and suggested
fixes for the problem.
 
.*B*
Commands are read thru M$SI. The following is a list/guide for using
The commands:
 
1) ARCHIVE = fid
 
   This specifies a file that will contain time stamps and names of
   thresholded packs. This is an optional feature.
 
2) WAIT = N
 
   'N' specifies the number of minutes to wait between checks.
   If 'N' is not specified or is equal to zero then GRAMPS will
   execute one time and then M$EXIT with STEPCC > 0 if a pack was
   found to be at or below threshold.
 
3) PSN = <pack name>
 
   This specifies a pack that is to be monitored for granule thresholding.
 
4) THRESH = N
 
   'N' specifies the number of granules that you don't want the just
   previously specified pack to fall below.
 
5) % = N
 
   'N' specifies the percentage of free space that you don't want the
   previously specified pack to fall below. Use either the THRESH or %
   directives. Don't use them both with the same pack (% takes precedence).
 
6) M = <message to be sent to the operator>
 
   The specified string will be sent to the operator if the pack reaches
   or falls below saturation. Multiple messages are legal.
 
7) HALF
 
   When half is mentioned about a monitored pack and that pack reaches
   the threshold the messages are sent and then the thresh hold is
   divided by 2. Subsequent checks against this pack use the newly
   computed threshold.
 
8) ANLZ
 
   Used in conjunction with the ARCHIVE feature. When ANLZ is mentioned
   GRAMPS will write the total and % free space available on the pack
   that was previously mentioned.
 
9) END
 
   On receipt of the END command GRAMPS will start monitoring all
   the specified packs.
 
NOTE: The user of GRAMPS.X must have FMDIAG and SPCLMM privelege.
 
      If GRAMPS is run from :SYS then anyone with access to GRAMPS
      can run the processor.

One pack example:
 
    !GRAMPS.X
 
    " This example does not use the ARCHIVE feature.
 
    WAIT = 30
 
         PSN = DP#SYS
              THRESH = 5000
 
              M = ---> DP#SYS GRANULE COUNT IS BELOW 5000 GRANULES.
              M = ---> SUGGEST:
              M = --->         1. NO MORE BATCH USERS
              M = --->         2. DELETE ALL JUNK FILES
              M = --->         3. TURN BATCH ON WHEN GRANULE COUNT>5000
    END
 
.*B*
Two pack example:
 
    !GRAMPS.X
 
    " ARCHIVE option is used here
 
    ARCHIVE = WATCDOG.MYACCT
 
    WAIT = 30
 
         PSN = DP#SYS
              % = 20
              M = ---> LESS THAN 20% FREE SPACE ON DP#SYS !!!!
              M = ---> HELP !!!!!
 
         PSN = DP#JUNK
              THRESH = 1000
              M = ---> GRANULE COUNT DP#JUNK < 1000 GRANULES !!!!
              M = ---> STUDENTS CANT BUILD ANY MORE FILES !!!!!
 
         END
