DONTECHO.X will turn off IBEX's ECHO flag and save its current status in a
command variable of your choice.
Full command line syntax:
 
!DONTECHO.X command_variable
 
where:
 
command_variable is the name of the command variable to receive the current
value of the IBEX ECHO flag.  The value of this variable will be 1 if ECHO was
ON, and 0 if ECHO was off.
Examples:
 
!DONTECHO.X ECHOSTATUS
!OUTPUT ECHOSTATUS
1
!"Hmmm, ECHO must be on
 
 
!"In an XEQ file
!DONTECHO.X ECHOFLAG
! .
! .
! .
!EXITLABEL: IF ECHOFLAG = 1 THEN ECHO
No more help for DONTECHO, sorry.
