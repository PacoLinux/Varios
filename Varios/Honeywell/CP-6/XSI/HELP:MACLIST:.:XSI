MACLIST is useful for generating listings of source files.  A table of contents
is printed at the end of the listing that contains the name and starting page
number of each source file listed.  Depending on the options selected the table
of contents may also contain entries for a single type of CNF (Crisman Normal
Form) commentary.
MACLIST is invoked with the command:
 
  !MACLIST.X sifid,uifid ON,listing (options)
 
The sifid may be wildcarded.  The uifid should not contain a file name if sifid
is wildcarded since the same update packet will then be used for all source
files.  The filename for the uifid always defaults to the same name as sifid.
The options are:
 
  NK - Do not print record keys or sequential record numbers on the
       listing.  Normally each record listed contains a record number
       generated sequentially for the updated listing output, the seqential
       record number or key of the input record (followed by a '*' if the
       record was from an update file) and the text of the input record.
 
  NRN - No Record Numbers.  This option is similar to NK, except that only the
       sequential record number is supressed.  The record key is still printed.
 
  *x* - This option selects the commentary type to be included in
       the table of contents.  The default is *F* commentary.  If *** is
       specified then no commentary entries will be put in the table of
       contents.  The commentary lines selected must be of the form
 
            *x* keyword: indexword
 
       or they will be ignored.  Indexword is terminated by a blank, period
       or end of record.
 
  STD - This option causes sifid to be treated as a standard file.
       Each line of the standard file contains the name of one file to be
       included in the listing.  Wildcards are not allowed.  Files are
       assumed to be in the same account as the standard file unless an
       account is specified in the file name.  All update files will be
       found in the uifid account.
Examples:
 
  !MACLIST.X ?_LCP6_?.SIACCT,.UIACCT ON,LP
  !MACLIST.X XXX:SI,XXX:UI ON,LP (*D*)
  !MACLIST.X NI?.:XXXSI (***) "Would not have found any comments anyway."
MACLIST - List MACRO file and produce table of contents.
