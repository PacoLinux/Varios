CCG - Displays all or a subset of all messages within a given comgroup.
 
To run: !CCG.X cg-file-name (options)
Options: AU=yes|no, MYSTATION=station, QSELECT=all|direct|anonymous,
         MSGID=decimal, ORIGIN=station, DEST=station, MSGTYP=msgtyp,
         REPORT=yes|no, DELETE=yes|no.
Options are: A/U [ = Y/ES ] - makes you the AU of cg-file.
             A/U = N/O - the default (you are not the AU).
             REP/ORT [ = Y/ES ] - Display message report (the default).
             REP/ORT = N/O - Don't display message report.
             DEL/ETE [ = Y/ES ] - Delete all selected messages.
             DEL/ETE = N/O - Don't delete all selected messages (the default).
             MY/STATION = station - connect station id.
             Note that "station" and "msgtyp" are specified as either
             'quote-string' or fid-string.
             The default connect station id is to let the system
             assign the id.
             The QSELECT, MSGID, ORIGIN, DEST, and MSGTYP options
             are exactly what M$FWCG would expect.
             The defaults are QSELECT=ALL, ORIGIN=?, DEST=?, MSGTYP=?,
             and MSGID=don't care.
