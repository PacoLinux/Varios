CONGO is a command processor that can be used to ensure that a given logon is
only allowed to log on as a console ghost.  It can also be used as a shell for
a more complete site-specific command processor.

1) CONGO must be installed as a CP.  You can use SPIDER to do this:
 
   !SPIDER
   SPIDER D00
   >INSTALL CONGO,CP FROM CONGO.X
   >END
 
However, the recommended technique is to put CONGO on your PO tape, and add a
TIGR SPROC subcommand to install it.
 
     SPROC(CONGO,CP),;
        .
        .
 
2) The logons you are concerned about should be allowed only online access and
have CONGO specified as its online CPROC.
