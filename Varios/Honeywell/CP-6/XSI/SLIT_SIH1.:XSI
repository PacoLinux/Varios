FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.
.*A*
Status LIne Time (SLIT) activates the builT-in clock of terminals having the
feature.
.*B*
SLIT checks the terminal type to see if it has a built-in clock as part of the
status line.  If it does it gets the current time from the system clock.  It
then sends the control sequence to initialize the clock.
.*K* SYNTAX INVOCATION_SYNTAX
Syntax:
    !SLIT.X [profile] [( options [)] ] where options are:
    T[IME]=  - number_of_hours_back
    T[IME]= [+] number_of_hours_ahead
    [PROFILE=] profile
 
If no "profile" is specified, the current profile will be used.
.*R*
 
For a list of supported profiles, type !H(SLIT.X) PRO SUPPORTED
.*K* PROFILE
[PROFILE=] profile
    Specifies what terminal profile that you wish to set the clock in.  If
    this PROFILE option is not specified, the current profile will be used.
    For a list of supported profiles, type another ?.
.*B* SUPPORTED
Currently supported terminals:
 
     VIP7801FC
     VIP7814
     BEEDM20
 PCT (pc terminal product)
     PCTX364, PCTX364GR, PCTV7800, PCTV7800GR, PCTV7800INV
.*K* TIME_MINUS
T[IME] [=] - number_of_hours
    Specifies the number of hours to be subtracted from the CP-6 time.
    For instance, a Hawian user of the LADC L66A might specify TIME=-2 to
    adjust for the 2 hours difference between Los Angeles (LADC L66A) and
    Hawaii.
.*K* TIME_PLUS
T[IME] [=] [+] number_of_hours
    Specifies the number of hours to be added to the CP-6 time.  For instance,
    a New York user of the LADC L66A might specify TIME=+3 to adjust for
    the three hour time difference between Los Angeles (LADC L66A) and New
    York.
