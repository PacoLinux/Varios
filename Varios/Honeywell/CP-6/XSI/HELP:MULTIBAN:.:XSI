You can now use your own font file by setting M$HERSHEY to the file that

06/29/82
The options NOW and TODAY are gone.  In their place are: TIME and DATE
with additional options.
 
The fonts Cartographic Roman, Complex Roman Index, and Complex Italic
Index are gone because they caused confusion.
 
New options are: CENTER, RATIO (sets the character width), SPACE (sets
vertical spacing), BLANKS (prints blank lines), vertical and horizontal
formats, overstrike control, and DAY (prints the current day).
CHANGES
The defaults are: FONT=DUPLEX ROMAN, SIZE=7, RATIO=22, NO CENTER,
SPACE=2, OVERSTRIKE='HIX', HORIZONTAL
Examples:
!MULTIBAN.X OVER ,LP(F='SIMPSCRPRO', S=9, 'Test', AND, TIME)
This will print in simple script, on one line "Test" followed by the
current time, on the line printer.
 
!MULTIBAN.X (F='GOTHGERPRO', S=10, 'Test', TOP, F=GE, S=9, 'Test')
This will print in gothic German "Test".  Then it will skip to the next
page, and print "Test" in gothic English.
Options in MULTIBAN are:
 
FONT     SIZE      TOP       DATE      DATE      TIME
DAY      AND       VERTICAL  HORIZONTAL          CENTER
NO_CENTER          SPACE     BLANK     RATIO     OVERSTRIKE
 
Options are executed from left to right.  It is therefore legal to
specify a font, text, then another font, and still more text. The first
text will be printed out in the first font, and the second text string
will be printed out in the second font.
 
The banner is output through M$LO, which can be a file or line printer.
The default M$LO assignment is ME.
 
The file that contains the fonts is read through M$FONT.  The default
name is XG$FONT.:LIBRARY; this file is shipped with the CP-6 graphics
system.
 
To get help with a particular option, type:
!HELP (MULTIBAN.X) OPTIONS option_name
 
Or, type "??" to get help for all options.

S[IZE] = character size
The character size is a rough indication of how large the character will
be.  Some fonts produce larger characters than others.
 
'text'
This is the text literal to be printed.
 
TOP
The TOP options causes a skip to top of page.
 
DAT[E] [( A[NS] )]
          L[OCAL]
          E[XT]
This prints the current date in the specified format.  The default
format is LOCAL.
 
T[IME] [( H[OUR] )]
          M[INUTE]
          S[ECOND]
This prints the current time.  The default format is: hh:mm.  However,
you may ask for just the two digits of the hour, minute or current
second.
 
DAY
The prints the current day of the week, using 3 characters.
 
AND
AND allows concantenation of two text strings.
 
V[ERTICAL]
This option causes the text to be printed vertically.
 
H[ORIZONTAL]
This causes the text to be printed horizontally.
 
C[ENTER]
This causes the text to be centered on the page.
 
N[O] C[ENTER]
This resets the centering option.
 
SP[ACE] = n
This sets the vertical spacing.  The default is 2 blank lines between
lines of text.
 
B[LANK] = n
This causes n extra blank lines to be printed.
 
R[ATIO] = n
This sets the character ratio.  The default is 22.  Smaller values
produce narrower letters, and larger values produce wider letters.
 
O[VERSTRIKE] = 'text'
This sets the character set to be used for printing the banner.  The
default is 'HIX', which means that when the banner is printed, the
character 'H' is used, then that is overstruck by 'I', then 'X'.
