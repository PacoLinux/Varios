BEAM transports files between CP-6 systems.  Destination wsn definitions must
have JE as a device defined, and output sent to JE@wsn must enter the input
symbiont to be run as a job.
 
Command syntax:
 
    !BEAM name[.[acct][.pass]][ how name[.[acct][.pass]]] @wsn
"name", "acct", and "pass" have their usual meanings.  "how" is one of "TO",
"ON", "OVER", or "INTO".  "wsn", which is required, represents the workstation
name of the destination.  Note that "@" in front of "wsn" must be preceeded by
a space.
 
Rules:
 
1.  The user must be authorized as a logon account at the destination.  This
avoids security conflicts.
 
2.  If "how" is omitted, "TO" is assumed.
 
3.  If the destination fid is omitted, the source name is used.
 
4.  The user must have FMSEC or write access to create or update a file in the
destination account if it is different from the source account.
 
5.  All disk file types and most tape file types may be BEAMed, regardless of
their contents.  Limit is 32K bytes per record.
 
For large files, transport via tape is faster and more reliable, since a file
of 1,000 granules would take 40 minutes or more to transmit at 19.2kb.

870209
Updated to allow more time, just in case an 8/44 or 8/47 gets the job. JLJ.
860221   JLJ
Fixed star 28406.  Entering a destination fid of the form A..B resulted in BEAM
generating a RES card that had blanks in it (i.e. ACC(       )).  It don't do
that now.  Geez.
851109 JLJ
Made BEAM not loop when prompting in an XEQ file.  Geez.
851008 JLJ
Removed PRIO=7 from JOB card.  Geez.
07/25/85 [by Frank Mayhar]
Fixed command-line parser to convert TO/ON/OVER/INTO to uppercase before
parsing, to close star 23403.  Geez.
05/16/83
Added 10-second fudge factor to assist running MAEB jobs on DPS 8/20 systems.
