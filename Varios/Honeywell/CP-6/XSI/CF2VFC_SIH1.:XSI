FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through CF2VFC.X
(LEN=79) prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the
lines of text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines
will end up per screen.

.*A*
CF2VFC converts a PC-style "continuous form" printer file to use CP-6 VFC.
CF2VFC runs under MS-DOS 2.1 or later.
.*B*
CF2VFC.X must be transferred to your PC using KERMIT or some similar file
transfer mechanism.  It must be named CF2VFC.EXE on your machine.
 
Full command line syntax:  Syntax:  cf2vfc [options] [input-file [output-file]]
 
The input and output files default to stdin and stdout, respectively.  Options
may be concatenated.
 
Example: cf2vfc /fgnoi-8u$ file.d1 file.d2
 
Legal options are:
 
/Bnn /D /G /H /I[-]nn /Lnn /O /K /S /Tnn /Uc
 
More complete option descriptions follow.
.*B*
Legal Options Are:
.*R*
 
/Bnn
     Set Bottom Margin to nn lines.
.*R*
/D
     Don't delete the output file when the program terminates abnormally.
.*R*
/G
     Translate IBM line graphics to '|', '-', '+' and '='.
.*R*
/H,/?
     HELP summary.
.*R*
/I[[-][nn]]
     Indent [-]nn spaces.
.*R*
/Lnn
     Page length.
.*R*
/N
     Don't optimize VFC.  No VFC optimizations other than top of form and
deleting blank lines at the end of a page will be done.
.*R*
/O
     Overwrite output-file if it already exists.
.*R*
/K
     Remove overstrikes according to the following priorities:
   1.  the leftmost character in the record has the highest priority, all other
things being equal
   2.  alphanumeric
   3.  printable ascii
   4.  if both are unprintable either the '#' character or the character
specified in the /U option is used.
.*B*
/S
     Scan the input file to determine the maximum output line length (not
including the VFC character) and safe undent value.  No output file will be
created.  However, a summary report for the input and output files will be
produced.  The K, N, B, L and T options will affect the summary report for the
output file.
.*R*
/Tnn
     Set Top Margin to nn lines.
.*R*
/Uc
     Translate unprintable characters to c.  Note that if a blank is desired
this must be the last option.

Added the /D option to allow the user to specify that output files shouldn't be
deleted when CF2VFC terminates abnormally.  Added some better interrupt
handling.
        <CTRL-BREAK> will cause the program to display its current status.
        <CTRL-C> will cause the program to display its current status and
                 then abort.  Note that <CTRL-C> processing may be disabled
                 by the MS-DOS command    "break off".
