Builds the intermediate files from x_CP6/DCB_C files.
 
!FPTCON.X si-file[,ui-file] [OVER out-fid]  [(opt)]
 
Options are:
    NOUI  - Don't abort if UI file doesn't exist
    OPTUI - Don't abort if UI file doesn't exist
    LS    - List names of macros encountered
 
No output files will be created unless out-fid is specified.  If
out-fid contains an account, the files created will be put in
that account.  If out-fid contains a file name, the output files
will be built by modifying that name, otherwise by modifying
si-file, which must then end in _C.
 
For a starting filename of x_y(_C), three or four files are created:
        x_y contains the decommented input, except default macro
                 parameters that begin with # (see 2, below).
        x$yV_C contains all of the FPT_, VLP_ and VLR_ macros
                 with the following modifications:
                 1 - The _ in the name is changed to $ and _V is
                     appended.
                 2 - All default macro parameters are deleted except
                     those that begin with % or # (which is removed
                     from the x_y file too), and FPTN=name and
                     BASED=BASED are added.
                 3 - All preprocessor commands except %MACRO and
                     %MEND and all macro invocations are removed
                     by default, but see description of /*!* below.
                 4 - If the FPT has a P area it is removed, the level
                     numbers of the V area are decreased by one, and
                     names are stripped of trailing #'s and %CHARTEXT
                     functions.
                 5 - All DCL statements are removed.
        x$yP_C is currently built only for F_CP6_C.  It is much
                 like the x$yV_C file, except it contains the
                 P area only.
        x$ENT contains the DCL statements.
 
        If x_y_C contains the string "DCB", then all the x$... files
        are replaced with these:
 
        x_y_D is the same as x_y, except the macro name is changed to
                 M$MDCB, and the macro text is terminated after the
                 first appearance of "(29127)".
        x$yM has the macro name and default for FPTN changed to x$y,
                 and both BASED and STCLASS accepted as the only other
                 default parameter.  All preprocessor directives are
                 removed except %MACRO and %MEND.
        x$y is the same as x$yM except that %MACRO and %MEND are also
                 removed, and names are stripped of trailing #'s.
 
A special comment that begins /*!* may be used to place
pre-processor directives in the x$yV_C or x$yP_C files.  The format
is the letter P (for x$yP_C) and/or the letter V (for x$yV_C)
followed by either the letter Y or the letter N.  Y indicates
that all following preprocessor commands are to be put into the
indicated file(s);  N (the default) indicates that they are
not.  For example:
/*!* VP Y */ will cause pre-processor commands to be put into
       both files, and
/*!* VP N */ will restore the default.

10/29/86 - #30951, allow preprocessor expressions in BASED or STCLASSof F$DCB.
           Requiring the suppression of ,; or ;, in the PUT routine.
12/15/83 - Recognize level numbers like %LVL and %(LVL...
           Preserve "blankness" after %CHARTEXT(...) to allow computed names.
01/04/84 - But don't split )% between output records.
6/15/83 - Allow blanks and commas in pre-proc expressions for INITs.
4/20/83 - Allow the blanks in: %N  =  1.
3/3/83 - Bug fix: (0:%(exp)) should make it intact to "V" file, not as (0:0)).
2/4/83 HELP updated to reflect current facilities. Made to recognize
       %L6# and %FILn for common L6/L66 system service files. Numerous
       bugs and inconsistencies fixed.  Probably introduced some!!
       !!CONTROL GROUP!! beware.
