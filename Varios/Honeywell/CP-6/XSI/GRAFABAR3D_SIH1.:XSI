FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
GRAFABAR3D creates a one-page three dimensional barchart of user-supplied input
data.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRAFABAR3D.X [input_file][ OVER graphics_file][,listing_file][(options)]
 
(at the moment, there are two incarnations of GRAFABAR3D in .X; GRAFABAR3D (for
the QMS laserprinter), and GRAFABAR3DDIG (which creates DIGIS files).
 
where:
 
input_file     is a file of GRAFABAR3D input in the format described below.
[Default is to prompt for data from the terminal.] DCB is F$105.
 
graphics_file  is the place you want the graphics to go.  DCB is GRAPHICS00 for
GRAFABAR3D, and GRAPHICS01 for GRAFABAR3DDIG.
 
listing_file   is the place you want the GRAFABAR3D "LO" to go to.  If you're
reading an input_file from a file, you probably want to say NO for this.  DCB
is F$108.
 
options are:
               BORDER - to create a 5% border around your chart.
               FRAME  - to draw a "frame" around the active plotting area.
 
.*B*
input_data is prompted for, always in the same order:
 
What is X-Y plane viewing angle (0-90,180-270)
.*R*
What is elevation viewing angle (0-90)
.*R*
What is plot title? (40 characters max)
.*R*
What is lower right corner notation text? (40 chars.)
.*R*
Input extra note text (for left-side) here; !EOD ends
.*R*
Enter x-axis (right-side) titles one per line; a blank entry or !EOD
indicates\N.*R*\Nthe end of x-axis data
.*R*
Enter y-axis (left-side) titles one per line; a blank entry or !EOD
indicates\N.*R*\Nthe end of y-axis data
.*R*
Enter data for each bar in the form
.*R*
x_label y_label value
 
At this point, data for each "bar" is accepted, followed by a !EOD record
 
The "bar data" is an X title, a Y title, and a positive integer separated by
spaces:
 
 PEAS JANUARY 100
 PEAS FEBRUARY 200
 BEANS JANUARY 15
 BEANS FEBRUARY 29
 
.*B*
The bar titles can be up to 16 characters in length.  If you need special
characters or embedded spaces, the items must be in quotes:
 
 'SEP 86' CORN 190
 
.*B*
GRAFABAR3D uses the CP-6 DIGS graphics system, which is a separately priced
product.  If you don't have it, maybe you should!  It's not that expensive.
