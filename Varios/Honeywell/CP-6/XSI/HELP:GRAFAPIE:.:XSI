GRAFAPIE creates single-page charts containing one or two pie charts per page.
Invocation syntax:
 
 !GRAFAPIE.X input_file OVER output_file,listing_file (options)
 
[Actually, at the moment, there are several incarnations of GRAFAPIE in LADC's
X account: GRAFAPIE (for the QMS1200 laserprinter), GRAFAPIEDEC (for DECVT125s
and DECVT241s), GRAFAPIETEK (for 4010-compatibles), and GRAFAPIEDMP (for the
DMP-29 plotter).  Use the version that matches the device you're using.]
 
 where:
 
input_file          is a file containing input commands for PIEGRAF.
                    DCB is F$105.
 
output_file         is a file containing the device-specific output
                    from PIEGRAF.  DCB is GRAPHICS00.
 
listing_file        is a file that the "LO" of PIEGRAF is to go into.
                    DCB is F$108.
 
and options are:
 
  BOR/DER - puts a margin around the edge of the chart
  FRA/ME  - draws a line around the "active area" of the chart.
GRAFAPIE.X will then prompt for input. After input has been entered the chart
will be drawn.
input_data is prompted for, but always in the same order:
 
 Title of chart (35 CHARS.)
 Notation for lower-right hand corner (35 chars.)
 Number of pie charts (1 or 2)
 Subtitle of first pie (25 CHARS.)
 Do you wish percentages to be printed (Y or N)
 Name (6 CHARS.), amount, broken out flag (Y or N)
 
At this point, data for the "pie" is accepted, followed by a !EOD record in XEQ
files or, separated by pressing the ESCAPE key, then the F key in an
interactive timesharing session.  Then, if you opted to print two pies, the
subtitle, percentage option, and data for the second pie is inputed.
