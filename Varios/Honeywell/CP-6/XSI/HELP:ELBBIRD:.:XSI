   ELBBIRD (DRIBBLE spelled backwards) is a program designed to convert
a file created by the !DRIBBLE command (or M$DRIBBLE service request)
from its original form to a more usable form.  It may also be used to
convert most files containing CP-6 VFC (Vertical Format Control)
characters to a VFC-less form.
 
Type "?" for more information.
DRIBBLE files (in their original form) contain one or more (usually
short) records for each terminal I/O request (read or write).  While
it is possible to re-create the visual characteristics of the original
terminal session by !COPYing the DRIBBLE file to an on-line terminal
or to a unit-record device such as a printer, it is not possible to
use the DRIBBLE file directly as input to TEXT (or EDIT, or any other
line-oriented text-processing program) without substantial manual
modification.  ELBBIRD provides a way to convert DRIBBLE (or other
VFC-containing) files to a directly usable form;  ELBBIRD reads the
DRIBBLE file and simulates the CP-6 VFC process, producing a VFC-less
EDIT-keyed file containing one record per "printable" line.

Allow ELBBIRD to output file to non-MAD packset per #34930.
03/27/87  LPH
Added the RING/NORING options so ELBBIRD won't stomp on DRIBBLEs of RING
sessions quite so easy!
860906.JLJ
Made changes to overstriking stuff per star 30631.  Don't blame me!
08/07/85 [by Frank Mayhar]
Added the DELTA/NDELTA option, and made ELBBIRD use X$PARSE to parse the
options.  Changed DVFC to be controlled by DELTA/NDELTA.
07/30/85 [by Frank Mayhar]
Added the OVERPRINT/NOVERPRINT options.  Also changed DVFC from 'A' to '@' to
make ELBBIRD work correctly with DELTA's activation chars.
1/2/85
Increased size of ELBBIRD buffers from 511 characters to 2048, to
permit ELBBIRD to operate properly with long (C00) terminal I/O
records.
5/9/83
Space-0-lines-and-overprint VFC code (back-quote, or FORTRAN '+')
did not work;  it does now.
8/20/82
If the last record in an ELBBIRD'ed file contained a "space N and
print" VFC code, the text of that record was never being written to
the output file.  This has been corrected.

SYNTAX
Notes:
 
   ELBBIRD attempts to produce a file which, when printed without
VFC, looks just like the original terminal session captured by the
!DRIBBLE command.  In doing so, it makes a few somewhat simple-minded
assumptions about how things like page-ejection VFC codes are to be
handled;  it does not (yet) handle things such as tab characters in
the data written to the terminal, skip-to-channel VFC codes, and the
like.  ELBBIRD handles overstriking (due both to VFC characters used
and to the presence of backspace characters in the records read or
written by the user) by simulating (for the most part) the actions
that would be taken by CP-6 if the data was being written to a CRT
terminal.  A blank or underscore overstruck by any printable character
is replaced by the printable character;  any character overstruck by
an identical character or by a blank or underscore is left unchanged;
any character other than a blank or underscore overstruck by any
other printable character is converted to an asterisk ('*') to
indicate an un-printable overstrike combination, unless the OVERPRINT
option is specified, in which case the overstruck character is replaced
by the overstriking character.
ELBBIRD has six options that affect its operation.  They are:
 
    DELTA, NDELTA, OVERPRINT, NOVERPRINT, RING, NORING
 
To obtain HELP information about a particular option, type:
 
    !HELP (ELBBIRD.X) OPTIONS option
 
or type a "??" at the next prompt to get information about all
the options.
 
The option descriptions are displayed in the following format:
  Option       Meaning
D/ELTA         Directs ELBBIRD to change its default VFC character (for use
               with records containing no VFC) from "A" to "@".  This causes
               ELBBIRD to correctly format DRIBBLEs from DELTA sessions, when
               the DELTA special activation characters were used.  The default
               is NDELTA.
 
ND/ELTA        Reverses the action of the DELTA option.  DRIBBLEs from DELTA
               sessions will not be correctly formatted.  This is the default.
 
NO/VERPRINT    Reverses the action of the OVERPRINT option.  When a printable
               character is overstruck with another printable character, they
               are replaced by a single asterisk ("*").  This is the default.
 
O/VERPRINT     Directs ELBBIRD to replace a printable character that is being
               overstruck by another printable character with the overstriking
               character.  (Does that make any sense?)  For more information,
               see the NOTES topic.  The default is NOVERPRINT.
 
R/ING          Directs ELBBIRD to check for the input file being the DRIBBLE
               of a RING session.  If ELBBIRD thinks it is then he will say so
               and stop!  The NORING option maybe used to bypass this check.
               The default is RING.
 
NO R/ING       Directs ELBBIRD NOT to check the input file for possibly being
               a RING session.  The default is RING.

Syntax:
 
   !ELBBIRD.X dribble_fid [ {ON|OVER} fid ] [(options)]
 
"dribble_fid" should be a file created by the !DRIBBLE command (or
the M$DRIBBLE monitor service), or a file containing records written
with CP-6 VFC.  "fid" may be specified to direct the output of
ELBBIRD to a specific file or device (e.g., "*TEMP", "ME", or "LP@");
if "fid" is not specified, "dribble_fid" will be replaced by the
VFC-less EDIT-keyed file.  "option" is any of OVERPRINT, NOVERPRINT,
DELTA, or NDELTA.  For more information, see the OPTIONS topic.
