Manual.
.*K* TRUNC
The TRUNC command toggles the X$FORMAT truncate flag.  When set, output data is
discarded once the buffer is filled.  When reset the buffer is printed and
emptied when it fills.  The truncate flag is initially reset.
 
Format:  TRUNC
 
.*K* BUFSIZE
The BUFSIZE command sets the size of the output buffer in characters.  This is
the size at which output will be truncated, or will wrap.  The maximum size is
255.  The buffer size is initially set to 255.
 
Format:  BUFSIZE number
 
.*K* FMT
The FMT command is actually composed of a list of options separated by commas.
The options are FMT, VAL, TXT and TXTC.  The option formats are:
 
 FMT='quoted format string'
 VAL=value
 VAL=(value1,value2,...,valueN)
 TXT='quoted text string'
 TXTC='quoted text string'
 
The FMT option provides the format string for X$FORMAT.  This option must be
specified exactly once.
 
The VAL option creates a block of binary data that will be presented to the
formatter in a single data vector.  Each repetition of this option creates
another data vector.  Each value may be a decimal number, optionally preceeded
by a minus sign, or a positive octal number preceeded by a period.
 
The TXT and TXTC options create a data vector framing a TEXT or TEXTC string
respectively.  Each repetition of these options creates another data vector.
 
.*K* EXAMPLES
 
 -FMT='This is a string'
 
 -FMT='%D decimal = %1P%O octal = %1P%H hexadecimal',VAL=1234
 
 -FMT='%T%A',TXTC='Append this ',TXT='to this'
 
 -TRUNC
 
 -BUFSIZE 65
