P is a program that lets the user define and recall input
functions.  Although not as powerful as IMP, P functions can
be referenced by names of up to ten characters in length... handy
when you run out of function keys to re-assign via IMP.
 
To build an input function, type
    !P.X name=function
where 'name' is the one to ten character name to be associated with
the input function, and 'function' is the text to be recalled.
 
To recall an input function, type
    !P.X name
where 'name' is the name of the input function to be recalled.
The associated text is then loaded into the Saved Input Buffer
to be recalled with  ESC-D.
 
To delete a previously-defined input function, type
    !P.X name=
where 'name' is the name of the function to be deleted
 
SO WHAT GOOD IS IT??????  Let's say that you have five modules that
you work on.  Your canned JCL might require quite a bit of substitut-
ion to work properly, so you stash away the !BATCH command.
 
EX:
    !P.X VA=BATCH $$PL6 X=VPA$PCL,TIME=2
    !P.X VB=BATCH $PARTRGE X=VPB$TREE,TIME=1
    !P.X VC=BATCH $$PL6 ',NAME=X'=',NAME=VPC$SETO',X=VPC$SETOUT,TIME=5
    !P.X VD=BATCH $$PL6 X=VPD$UTIL,TIME=11
    !P.X LP=BATCH $LINK X=PCL
    !P.X M=M IS THE 530 CONNECTED??
    !P.X S=SL.X PCL.:SPGN
    !P.X UM=FPTCON.X UM_CP6_C.:B00SI,UM_CP6_C OVER .:SPOU
 
will build a bunch of input functions for compilation, linking, and
so on.  Next time you finish some minor changes to UM_CP6_C, you
type '!P.X UM' and the command goes into your buffer.  Retrieve it
with ESC-D, edit it if need be (like add ',BC=4' to a compile) and
hit the RETURN key.
 
NOTE:  The input functions are stored in a file '$$P' in the
       LOGON account.  This could cause problems if the logon account
       is not authorized for disk space.  It does insure that you will
       always be able to access your personal input functions irrespective
       of what your directory happens to say.
