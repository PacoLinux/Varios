ST is useful for determining certain performance characteristics of
a job or session. It always reports the peak memory used by the
job (JPK) and step (SPK) and the maximum authorized (MAX), and number of STEPS.
In addition, a number of things from JIT are reported as totals for
the job, and on 2nd and subsequent invocations, as an increment
since the previous invocation. These quantities are:
#PMMES, #I/O'S, Wall time in seconds (UTS), Execution time,
Service time, and page-seconds for both processor and user.
Other reports show memory utilization and cpu, I/O, and memory hogs.
 
ST writes through M$LO.  When ST is simply invoked, it reports
on the running job. If the user has SPCLMM privilege, other facilities
are available. If it is invoked ST.X (option), reports on other users
are given (parens not required around options). Allowable options are:
         n - Report on user with SYSID n
         Un|un|.n - Report on user n (n is octal)
         B|b - Report on all batch users
         O|o - Report on all online users
         G|g - Report on all ghost users
         T|t - Report on all transaction processing users
         A|a - Report on all users
         M|m - Show memory breakdown for all users.
         H|h - Show the top six users of CPU, Memory, and I/O in that order.
 
The M and H options may be followed immediately by a mode specification
(BOGTbogt) to restrict the display to the specified mode. For example:
ST.X (ho) will display only the online hogs.
