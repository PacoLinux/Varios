    GOPHER finds text strings, possibly wildcarded, in files.  GOPHERs function
is similar to the EDIT FT command except that normally more than one file is
searched.
  !GOPHER.X [sifid] [,uifid] [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO} ,listing] [(options[)]]
"sifid"
    Identifies those file(s) to be searched (after any updates from "uifid"
    have been applied).  The name portion of the fid can be and usually is
    wildcarded.  If no name is specified, '?' is assumed.  If neither "sifid"
    nor "uifid" is specified, all files in the current File Management Account
    (FMA) are searched (I.E. '?.' is assumed).
"uifid"
    Usually specifies an account to read updates for those base file found in
    the "sifid".  If the name field in "uifid" is wildcarded, then only files
    in the "si" account that also have updates in the "ui" account will be
    searched.
"listing"
    Identifies where GOPHER should write most of his output.  Default is ME.
"options"
    Are one or more GOPHER options, separated by commas.
 
Strings are read through M$STRING (which defaults to ME); each record is a
string.  Null record or EOF is end of strings.
"Sifid" file(s) are read.  Each record is searched for an occurrence of any of
the specified string(s).  If any strings are found in a record, the record is
written to "listing", with its EDIT key or record number.  If "uifid" or the UI
option is specified, "sifid" file is updated with plus-cards from "uifid" file
(if it exists) during reading, before string matching.  Name of the file is
written to "listing" before any records are written, if any records are to be
written.

AF[ter] = n
    Tells GOPHER to display "n" records after each record containing any of
    the specified strings.  "n" may be in the range 0 to 9, inclusive.  When
    the AFTER and/or BEFORE options are specified, lines which contain any of
    the strings being searched for will have '>>' printed between the record
    number/EDIT key and that records contents.  Specifying a "n" of 0 (zero)
    will nullify any AFTER command specified via the GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS command
    variable.
AN[y] [f[iles]]
    Tells GOPHER to search all records in the selected files.  This is the
    default and may be used to reverse the effects of the TEXT FILES ONLY
    option which may have been specified via the GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS command
    variable.
B[efore] = n
    Tells GOPHER to display "n" records before each record containing any of
    the specified strings.  "n" may be in the range 0 to 9, inclusive.  When
    the AFTER and/or BEFORE options are specified, lines which contain any of
    the strings being searched for will have '>>' printed between the record
    number/EDIT key and that records contents.  Specifying a "n" of 0 (zero)
    will nullify any BEFORE command specified via the GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS
    command variable.
When BREAK or ESC B is typed, the number of files searched so far
(including the current one) will be shown and one of the following will
occur:
 
If no file is currently OPEN for searching, a line of the form:
  At file name.account
is printed.
 
If the currently OPEN file IS being searched, a line of the form:
  At record xx (yy remain) in file name.account
is printed.
 
If two or more BREAKs are hit in rapid succession (less than one second apart),
a line of the form:
  At record xx (yy remain) in file name.account; Enter C,F,Q or ?:
is printed.  If 'C' is entered, GOPHER continues as if BREAK had never been
hit.  If 'F' is entered, the current file is CLOSEd (if it was OPEN) and GOPHER
resumes with the next file.  If 'Q' is entered, the current file is CLOSEd and
GOPHER exits, after printing the normal summary line.  If '?' is entered,
commentary describing the above options is printed and the user is again
prompted for one of the above responses.
BREAK
UPPERCASE
UPPERCASE
10/06/92  #41899, 10/06/92 WGL
    UTS changes.
09/14/92  #41736, 09/29/92 JLJ
    Added three options (DEPTH will only search n records, EBCDIC allows GOPHER
    to search EBCDIC files), COUNTF forces a files-searched summary to print
    message to print when break is hit.
03/20/88  TJC
    Added a record to an output file giving file name(s), account and
    options as noted in star 34901.
11/25/87  LPH
    Fixed bug that would cause some files not to be searched completely when
    the TEXT option was specified.  Also changed the definition of TEXT
    to include SUB, RS, US and DEL since these characters are valid VFC
    characters and may appear in ORG=UR files.
09/16/87  LPH
    Fixed bug with BEFORE/AFTER option that caused records from the previous
    file to be printed under certain circumstances.
07/16/87  LPH
    Fixed bug that caused "Memory fault" when recursive %INCLUDE file
    condition was not properly detected (file "a" contained a comment line
    of "%INCLUDE a;").  Also made GOPHER skip ComGroup files.
 
    Added the AFTER, ANY FILES, BEFORE and TEXT FILES ONLY options.
 
    Also taught GOPHER about COBOL COPY files so that COPY files will be
    searched when the SRCH option is present.
09/08/86
    Fixed Missing Page fault problem as per star 30658.
06/23/86
    Added the UISRCH option as per star #29428.  Also fixed a bug with the
    SRCH option and added IREL as a legal value on the ORG and NORG options.
12/3/84
    Added the SRCH option.
10/09/84
    Changed GOPHER to use the "official" wildcard routines now supplied
    in the :LIBRARY account.  There should be no visable change to the user.
06/03/84
    When GOPHER encounters a STOWed file, he now just ignores it and goes on
    to the next file instead of printing an error message.  This was requested
    in STAR #17592.
07/24/83
    Put in a disclaimer telling why users will be unable to compile this
    version of GOPHER at their site.
06/09/83
    Made wildcarded SKIP file names ALWAYS work.
05/25/83
    Fixed bug that prevented use of DEFAULTS and STD option.
05/15/83
    Added the GREETING, LIST_DEFAULTS, NO_DEFAULTS, NO_GREETING,
    NO_LS_DEFAULTS, NO_PROMPT, NO_SUMMARY, PROMPT, SUMMARY AND WARNING
    options.  Also implemented user definable defaults (see DEFAULTS).
    For details on any of the above options, type H(GOPHER.X) option.
12/08/82
    Lee Hallin added the ECHO, END, MAKESTD, NORGS, NRECS, NTYPES, NWARN, ORGS,
    SKIP, START, STD, STRINGS, TALLY_ONLY and TYPES options.
09/07/82
    ** The Wizard ** added the UC and Q options; changed all %SUBs to %EQUs.
 1. GOPHER now uses the C00 version of XUU$READ which in turn
   now uses fast sequential I/O for reading source and update
   files. You should find that the new GOPHER is about twice as
   fast as the old one for consecutive files.
 2. A bug in GOPHER which caused it to quit without an error
   message if it encountered a file it did not have access to
   has been corrected. It will now tell you about it and go
   merrilly on.
 3. GOPHER will now act somewhat differently than before on
   strange files. In times past, it thought that any I/O error
   meant end-of-file. It now understands a couple of errors as
   recoverable errors, most notably  LOST DATA. It will now
   continue searching the files but will give a report at the
   end of any file which had lost data problems telling how many
   records had the problem.
COUNTF/ILES
     Tells GOPHER to print the number of files searched so far when BREAK
     is hit.
CHANGES
GOPHER now has the facility for each user to (for the most part) create
default options to meet his/her needs.  This is done via the use of a command
variable (GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS).  Prior to invoking GOPHER (typically done in
your SETUP file that get executed when you logon to CP-6), you do a IBEX
LET command assigning a value to GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS equal to those options that
you wish to be YOUR GOPHER defaults.  Then when you invoke GOPHER, he will
get his defaults from GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS and any other options specified
normally on the command line.
Example:
    Say that in the past you almost always specify the NoWarn and
    NTYPES=(R,O6,DM) options.  To have these automagically be YOUR defaults,
    simply do a:
      !LET GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS='NW,NTYPE=(R,O6,DM)'
    command prior to invoking GOPHER.  When you invoke him, he will indicate
    (unless you tell him otherwise) which options he is using as defaults.
D[epth] = n
    Tells GOPHER to not search more than "n" records deep in a file.
EBC[DIC]
    The input files are in the EBCDIC character set instead of ASCII, so
    it is necessary to convert the string before searching it.
EC[ho] [F[ids]]
    Causes each file name to be printed when the file is OPENed for searching.
E[nd] = file-name
    Tells GOPHER to stop when a file name >= 'file-name' is encountered.  If
    not specified, the search will stop at the end of the account.
  !" The following would search all files in the current File Management
  !" Account (FMA) for occurrences of the string COPYRIGHT
  !GOPHER.X    " Note: The ? is no longer required in the DCB1 position! "
  COPYRIGHT
 
  !" The following would search all of account .:XSI except:
  !"  1) Those files with TYPE=R (Run Units)
  !"  2) Those files with TYPE=O6 (PL6 Object Units)
  !"  3) The file named PROOF_DIC
  !"  4) Those files whose name begins with 'HELP:'
  !GOPHER.X .:XSI (NTYPES=(R,O6),SKIP=(PROOF_DIC,HELP:?)
  SOMESTRING
 
  !" The following would search all files in account .:XSI with names
  !" beginning with O.  It would search those files for the string 'copyright'
  !" regardless of what case mixture the word is composed of (i.e. copyright,
  !" CoPyRiGhT, COPYRIGHT will all match).
  !GOPHER.X O?.:XSI(UC
  copyright
  !" The following might be a typical use for the DEFAULT facility.
  !" If you only have one account and in that account are source, object units,
  !" run units, etc., you may wish to have GOPHER "normally" NOT search the
  !" run units, object units and MAIL files.  Furthermore, you would like the
  !" W=? and NWARN options to be the defaults.  To do this you could EDIT the
  !" SETUP file that gets executed when you logon and insert a line like:
    !LET GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS='NW,W=?,NTYPES=(R,O6,DM)'
  !" Then on subsequent GOPHER invocations, you need only specify additional
  !" options on the command line.
 
  !" Or, suppose you really don't like the GREETING, PROMPT and SUMMARY added
  !" to this version of GOPHER.  Not to worry!  Just do a:
    !LET GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS='NG,NS,NP'
  So now if GOPHER doesn't do the right thing automatically, it's DEFAULT of
  the user!
G[reeting]
    Tells GOPHER to announce himself (ex. GOPHER C00 here (5/15/83)).  This
    is usually used when the NO GREETING is among the users DEFAULT options
    (see DEFAULTS) and the user wishes to override that default.
NWARN
NORGS
NTYPES
Limit: (Number of Strings) + (Number of occurrences of wildcard) < 99.
L[i] [S[t]] D[efaults]
    Tells GOPHER to list any user specified GOPHER defaults (see DEFAULTS).
    This option is usually used to override the NO LS DEFAULT option that
    was specified as a default option (see DEFAULTS).
LIST_DEFAULTS
M[ake] [S[td]]
    Causes GOPHER to only write "fids" to "listing".  The file created can then
    be used as a CP-6 STD file and/or used on subsequent GOPHER uses via the
    STD option.
NO[rgs] { = org1 | [=] ( org1,org2,...) }
    Ignore files with any of the specified ORGs.
{ N[o] D[efaults] | D[ont] [U[se]] D[efaults] }
    Instructs GOPHER to ignore any previously set default options set via
    the GOPHER_X_DEFAULTS command variable (see DEFAULTS).
{ N[o] G[reeting] | D[ont] G[reet] }
    Instructs GOPHER not to announce his presence (i.e. don't say
    GOPHER C00 here (5/15/83)) when invoked.
{ N[o] L[s] D[efaults] | D[ont] L[i] S[t] D[efaults] }
    Instructs GOPHER not to list any user defaults.  This option is normally
    used itself as a default option (see DEFAULTS).
{ N[o] P[rompt] | D[ont] P[rompt] }
    Instructs GOPHER to prompt with a asterisk (*) instead of the more
    fancy/informative prompt (1st string: ,2nd string:, etc.).
{ N[o] S[ummary] | D[ont] S[ummarize] }
    Instruct GOPHER not to give the summary of how many strings were found
    in how many files that is normally given by GOPHER at the conclusion of
    a search.
N[umber] R[ecords] { < | = | > } value
    Only search files whose number of records has the indicated relation to the
    specified value.
NT[ypes] { = type1 | [=] ( type1,type2,...) }
    Ignore files with any of the specified type(s).
{ N[o] W[arnings] | I[gnore] E[rrors] }
    Causes the 'There were xx records which were too long to be searched
    completely.' message to be suppressed.

OR[gs] { = org1 | [=] ( org1,org2,...) }
    Search ONLY files with the specified ORGs.
Lee Hallin, LADC
P[rompt]
    Instructs GOPHER to give fancy/informative prompts (ex. 1st string: ).
    This option is usually used to override the NO PROMPT option that was
    specified as a default option (see DEFAULTS).
Q[UIT]
    Quit scanning for a string once it is found (i.e., a "find first"
    function).  When one instance of each search string is found, GOPHER quits.
R[esidual]
    When specified along with the QUIT option, prints a list of any of the user
    selected "strings" that were not found during GOPHERs search.
SK[ip] { = file-name1 | [=] ( file-name1,file-name2,...) }
    Skip the specified files even if they meet all other criteria specified.
    'file-name?' may be wildcarded.
SR[CH] [(acct [,acct] )]
    This option tells GOPHER to search through any include files
    found in the source.  Includes may be nested up to 12 levels.
    Up to 8 accounts may be specified for the search list.  In
    addition to any specified accounts, :LIBRARY and the user's
    running account will be searched.
 
    In general, this option will work with most FORTRAN, PL6, and
    PARTRGE source.  If the INCLUDE line is continued across more
    than one line, then it will not be searched.  If the INCLUDE
    line is within a multi-line PL6 comment, and it is otherwise
    syntactically valid, then it will be searched.
ST[art] = file-name
    Start the search at the specified file or beyond.  If not specified, the
    search starts with the first file in the account.
STD = fid
    Read 'fid' for a list of fids to search.  The fids in the STD file MAY be
    wildcarded.
STR[ings] = fid
    Read the strings to search for from 'fid'.
 
Wildcarding of strings -- Suppose you said "W=?" on GOPHER options,
   and one string is "ABC?XXX".  Then sifid records like
        ARGLEBARGLE ABCXXX
   and  BLOTTOABCZZZZZ XXX
   would match the string.  But
        XXX ABC
   would not match.
SU[mmary]
    Instructs GOPHER to give a summary line at the end that indicates how
    many strings were found in how many files.  This option is usually used
    to override the NO SUMMARY option that was specified as a default option
    (see DEFAULTS).
TA[lly] O[nly]
    Tells GOPHER to process files in the normal manner but to suppress the
    printing of the file names and the records containing the specified
    strings.
TE[xt] [F[iles]] [O[nly]]
    When this option is specified, GOPHER will stop searching a file if a non
    printable character that is not a BS (BackSpace), HT (Horizontal Tab) or
    BEL (a bell) is encountered.  The effects of this option may be reversed
    via the ANY FILE option.
 
    This option was added for convenience at the cost of additional overhead.
    It is MUCH more efficient to use the NTYPE, NORG and/or SKIP options to
    bypass certain files when the file base being searched permits their use.
TY[pes] { = type1 | [=] (type1,type2,...) }
    Search ONLY files with the specified file type(s).
UPPERCASE
UIS[RCH] (.acct [,.acct ... ])
    Normally at most one UI account may be specified (via the UI/DCB2 position
    on the command line).  This option allows you to specify up to 8 UI
    accounts to be searched.  Each of the accounts is searched, in the order
    specified, until the file is found or until the account list is exhausted.
{ U[pper] C[ase] | C[aseless] [C[ompares]] }
    Convert input records to upper case prior to testing for matches.  E.g.,
    "AbcD" on an input record will match the user string "ABCD".
WA[rnings]
    Instructs GOPHER to put out the 'There were xx records which were too
    long to be searched completely.' message.  This option is usually used
    to override the NO WARNING option that was specified as a default option
    (see DEFAULTS).
W[ildcard] [C[haracter]] [= 1-character]
    Indicates that '1-character' is the character to be used as the wildcard
    character.  If '= 1-character' is ommitted, '?' is assumed.  See also,
    HELP(GOPHER.X) STRINGS.
