Invocation:
 
          [command-file]
   !MOM.X [            ]
          [ (commands) ]
 
   where:
      command-file:  is the name of the file that contains
                     MOM commands.
                     See HELP (MOM.X) COMMANDS for more info.
 
      commands    :  a list of MOM commands.
                     See HELP (MOM.X) COMMANDS for more info.
 
If MOM is invoked without a command-file or commands MOM will
display the default screen (screen 0).
 
If you want the Command Screen, hit any key.
 
Type "?" for more information.

MOM has three commands on the command screen that affect her
operation.  They are:
 
                            1) Change sleep time.
                            2) Change refresh multiplier.
                            3) Change screen.
 
Changing the sleep time changes the number of seconds between screen
updates.  Changing the refresh multiplier changes how often the
screen will be updated: once every N sleep times. (This is a
feature.) Changing the screen simply changes which screen is
displayed and returns you to that screen.
 
Type "?" for more information.
.*B*
The Mom Command Language(MCL) consists of 5 commands.  They can be
combined in any order and may be reused if necessary.
 
  1.  INT/ERVAL = num
  2.  label:
  3.  GO SCR/EEN scrn [num2 TIME/S]
  4.  GOTO label [num2 TIME/S]
  5.  EX/IT | E/ND | Q/UIT | X/IT
 
  Where
     - scrn   : The number of the screen to
                be displayed.  If MOM doesn't
                have that number of screen she
                will display screen 0.
     - num   : any positive decimal number
     - num2  : any positive decimal number.  If
               not present the default is 1.
     - label : any identifier consisting of
               uppercase letters, digits and
               $,_,#,@.  The first character
               must be a letter.
 
Type "?" for more information.
.*B*
 
 EXAMPLE:
    MOM  (INTERVAL= 30, START:, GO SCREEN 0 5 TIMES,;
          GO SCREEN 1 2 TIMES, GO SCREEN 2 2 TIMES,;
          GO START 5 TIMES, EXIT)
 
    1.  Set the screen refresh time to 30.
    2.  Remember label START is at node 2.
    3.  Display screen 0, and refresh it 5 times.
    4.  Display screen 1, and refresh it 2 times.
    5.  Display screen 2, and refresh it 2 times.
    6.  Set loop counter to 5 and go back to node 3,(START+1).
    7.  After going to START 5 times, go on.
    8.  EXIT.
 
The commands may be on the command line, as shown above, or read in
from a file.  Either way, CP-6 line continuation is implemented, so
the commands may be on separate lines provided a ';'(semicolon) is
placed at the end of the line.  The comma is the delimiter between
commands and is required.
 
Type "?" for more information.
 
.*B*
MOM currently has three screens, numbered 0 to 2. The 0 screen is
the default, and contains various statistics about the operation of
CP6.  Screen 1 displays information about online users, and screen 2
displays info about running and waiting batch users.
 
MOM needs certain privileges to run.  If you don't have these privs,
MOM will tell you that, and will exit.  If MOM is being run from the
:SYS account, SPCLMM priv is required.  All other privs MOM needs are
either ignored (the information is not displayed), or are already
LINKed into the MOM rununit.
 
Comments, suggestions, criticisms are invited.

.*K* OVERVIEW
 
    MOM,  the Master Operations Monitor, is a utility program that
is used  to produce a real-time updated display of important system
parameters.    She was made as flexible as possible, to allow
special-purpose displays and to make it as easy as possible to
retailor existing  displays or to produce entirely new displays for
different applications.   MOM uses the cursor positioning and
special screen attribute (if any) capabilities of the terminal upon
which she is run to produce well-formatted, easy-to-read displays.
 
  If you want to add new screens or change existing screens, please
see the source, and the TEXT input file MOM_SIT.:XSI.
.*K* IOCACHE
 
     As the I/O cache display on screen 0 is rather cryptic, here is
an explanation.
 
     The I/O cache on CP6 is a method of reducing the total number of
I/Os and of improving performance.  It consists of a table of disk
granules cached in free memory.  The statistics that MOM displays have
the following meanings:
 
      "Hits"          - The percentage of attempts to find some-
                        thing in the I/O cache that succeeded.
 
      "I/O trunc/min" - "I/O cache truncs per minute," or the
                        average number of times per minute that
                        old information is cleaned out of the I/O
                        cache table.
 
      "SP trunc/min" -  "Shared processor truncs per minute," or
                        the average number of times per minute that
                        old information is cleaned out of the
                        shared-processor table.
.*K* CHANGES_FROM_B03 B03_MOM OLD_MOM
    This some information for those installations that got MOM
directly from SFA on B03.  If you're interested, type a "?".
.*B*
    MOM B00 has been completely upgraded for CP6 C00.  The cursor-handling
code uses the C00 profile structure, some problems with ANS terminals has
been fixed, and privilege handling has been completely changed.  Most of
these changes are entirely transparent, with the exception of privilege
handling.
 
     MOM now conforms to most privileged X account tools in the way she handles
needed privileges.  The "authorized-account" list has completely disappeared.
When MOM resides in .:SYS, the only privilege needed to run her is SPCLMM.
This will enable one to see all MOM displays, including ones that would
not be informative if MOM were not in .:SYS (e.g. the free #SYS grans display,
which requires FMDIAG priv).  When MOM resides in the X account, the user
running her needs to be authorized SPCLMM and DISPJOB, and must have FMDIAG
turned on (this is not necessary to run MOM, but will let the user see the
free #SYS grans display).  You must have PM turned on to get the STATs
displays.
 
To continue, type "?".
.*B*
     Outside of the previously-mentioned differences, B00 MOM is identical
to A00 MOM.  Screens work and are defined the same way, and data-gathering
routines are identical.  Some differences exist in what is now displayed,
but these are minimal, and (in my opinion) provide more information about
the actual running system than before.
.*K* STATS EXECUTION MONITOR SERVICE WAIT IDLE
     Here is a brief explanation of the stats display:
 
          % Execution     Percent of time spent executing users' code.
 
          % Service       Percent of time spent servicing users' monitor
                          service calls (PMMEs).
 
          % Wait          Percent of time spent in I/O wait, resource wait,
                          or both.
 
          %Monitor        Percent of time spent performing non-user tasks.
 
          % Idle          Percent of time spent idle with nothing happening.
 
For more information, see the System Support Reference Manual's description
of the STATS processor.
.*K*   COMMANDS
