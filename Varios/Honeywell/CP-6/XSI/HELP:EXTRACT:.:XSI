EXTRACT manipulates the extractable commentary in source files. It can extract
the commentary into a compact data base which it can then use to create Error
message files (with optional sorted appendices), Manual files (to be formatted
by TEXT), and selective content reports.  It is designed to provide efficient
access to EXTRACT data bases and thus minimize the necessity for reference to
EXTRACT listings on microfiche.
All commands and keywords may be abbreviated to the least ambiguous number of
characters except where noted.
 
The HELP feature in EXTRACT is similar to the rest of the CP6 system. Type
'HELP' for help, 'HELP cmd' for help with a specific command or '?' for more
detail of the current help or error message.  Help information is available for
the following:
COMMANDS           - Lists commands and their purpose
DCBS               - Lists DCBs used and their function
command-name       - Details for the command

BUILD
BU[ild] status Fid1 [, [Fid2] [,Fid3]] type [,App1 [,App2 [,App3]]]
   status = ON   - create a new message file. If one exists, abort the command.
            INTO - update an existing file.
            OVER - create a new file. If one exists, overwrite it.
 
   fid1 is the output file name ( valid CP6 fid )
   fid2 is the file identifier for %SUBs file. It may be spelled with '??' as
the first two characters, which will be replaced by FCG of the module name
(e.g. ??_PERR_C is CP_PERR_C for IBEX but VP_PERR_C for PCL).
   fid3 is a listfile (or prefix+?) to use a subset of the data base.
 
   type = SCR[eech]   - use *S* comments and set the monitor bit.
          MON[itor]   - use *E* comments and set the monitor bit.
          PRO[cessor] - use *E* comments and reset the monitor bit.
          TEST        - use *E* comments and build a QUAC testing error file
                        that ONLY DONALD.:QUACM can understand.
   App1 = Fid for appendix file type A. (First line, number sort).
   App2 = Fid for appendix file type B. (All lines, number-FCG sort).
   App3 = Fid for appendix file type C. (First line, name sort).
 
If any Appn is null but its comma is present, -NO, -MS, or -NM will be
concatenated to fid1. To get App2 but not App1, say ',NO,fid'.  If F$112 is SET
with RECL>50, then all three Apps will be wrapped that wide.
12/23/88 - Fixed star 37035 - Support for mixed-case error Equs, etc.
11/6/86 - Made search by NAM containing single blanks work.

EXTRACT
EX[tract] Fid       ( Fid is any valid CP6 File ID ).
 
Extracts from the source file Fid into the data base. If Fid has no account,
the one in M$SI is used.  You must have write access to the data base.  If M$UI
is SET to a file fid, updates will be applied from its account if a file of the
same name exists there.
EXTRACT will determine the source type by the first non-blank source line.
 
         PL6     - /* or ; ...   (anywhere)
         FORTRAN - C .........   (in column 1)
         BASIC   - REM or ! ..   (in column 1, See Note)
         APL     - $COM ......   (in column 1)
         CP6PROC - " or !" ...   (in column 1, most CP-6 utilities)
         TEXT    - . (dot)....   (in column 1)
         IDL     - -- (dashes)   (in column 1)
         other   - * .........   (in column 1 or 7)
 
Notes:
1. The first line must uniquely determine the source type - e.g. a PL6 program
whose first line is: C:   PROC   looks like a FORTRAN program.
2. For Basic Programs the first record MUST NOT have a line number.  EXTRACT
will skip over them on subsequent records.
 
Comments for all subsequent records may start anywhere but must be the first
non-blank characters of the record.
Extractable comment syntax: <Cmt start><Comment type>*<text><Cmt end>.  If the
'Cmt start' does not end with a '*' then you(the programmer must add one. For
example in FORTRAN : 'C*M*' would be the style for 'M' type comments.
 
In non-PL6 code, lines that are continuations of a previous commented line must
use either a ',' as the comment or the SAME letter to inform EXTRACT that this
is part of the last comment set.  The use of the same keyword as started it
will terminate the current comment and begin a new one if the types are the
same.
 
Lines will be copied without leading or trailing blanks, blank-asterisks, or
comment definition characters with the following exceptions:
   1. Leading character stripping stops at the position of the first non-(blank
or *) of the first record of the packet (usually NAME:).
   2. Leading * and blank stripping is suppressed following a line ending in a
double colon (::). Comment definition (e.g *,*) is still stripped.
 
A name is required for most comment types, but is obtained in various ways,
usually following a keyword:
   M,P - not needed.
   F,I,Q - keyword (NAME:) - required.
   D - keyword (NAME:) - optional. If absent, previous D-name is used, or none.
   K,B,V,N - whatever is where a keyword should appear.
   E - keyword (ERROR:) - required, name format restricted (see below).
   S - keyword (SCREECH_CODE:) - required, format restricted also.
   O - keyword (MESSAGE:) - required, use quotes to include blank, *, etc.
   C - keyword (VERSION:) - required.
 
Keywords may be spelled with lower case characters if desired, so long as the
same spelling is used to start a new packet of the same type.  The name for E
and S comments consists of three parts: prefix, code, and severity.  The parts
may be separated by dash (-) or underscore (_), but not both, and if severity
is present and underscore is used, severity must be one character long (since
code may properly contain underscores).  Only code is required, and may be a
name or a number, optionally preceded by a percent (%).  A name is not
permitted to begin with a digit.  The prefix is limited to four characters,
although the fourth character is reserved for use in Quacery and causes a BUild
command error otherwise.

MANUAL
MA[nual] Fid1,Fid2  or DO[cument] Fid1,Fid2
   fid1 is the command file. Its first two records may be:
      SECTION=<character string> (maximum 78 characters)
      HEADING=<character string> (maximum 79 characters)
Thereafter is a listfile of *F* comment names to be included in the manual.  If
the name ends in ?, it is treated as a prefix and for a Manual command *K*
comments associated with selected *F*'s are also included.  For DOcument, *P*,
*F*, *D*, and *I* are always included.  For MAnual, the SECTION/HEADING
information may be replaced or combined with any number of control directives
whose first three characters consist of "*", followed by ">" or "<", followed
by "*", "F", or "K".  The default set of directives is:
     *<*.HBB
     *<*||%HH|
     *<*||%W0|
     *<*.HBE
     *<*.ALL
     *<*.SPB 7
     *<*.FBB
     *<*||%SS%PAGENO%|
     *<*.FBE
     *<F.HBB
     *<F||%HH|
     *<F||%W0|
     *<F.HBE
     *<F.BRP
     *<F
     *<F.INL 0
     *<K.INL 5
     *<K.UNL 5
     *>K.SPB
     *>F.SPB
 
Anything after the first three characters will be placed in the output before
(if *<x) or after (if *>x) the text of every corresponding comment type (F or
K, but *<* means only the first F-type, and *>* means only the last of any
type).  Substitutions are performed for %HH, %SS, %Wn, and %Nn, which are
SECTION, HEADING, Word-n of the NAME: comment line, and F-name (N1) or K-name
(N2), respectively.  If n is 0 then all words will be substituted.  If any
substitutions are requested but none are satisfied, the entire line will be
suppressed.  If %W0 appears, the NAME: comment line and any blank lines
following will be suppressed.  If any %Wn has n too large, a preceding blank
will be suppressed.
 
   fid2 is the output (TEXT input) file and must not already exist.
For both MA and DO commands, if a line of extracted commentary begins with .XEQ
(case-blind) then the rest of the line will be interpreted as the fully
qualified comment name of a commentary packet that is to replace this line,
starting with the first non-blank line after the first line of the packet.  A
fully qualified name consists of the module-name, *F*-or-*P*-name, and any
*K*-*D*-*I*-name, in that order, separated by blanks.  If no name follows the
 .XEQ, the line is ignored unless a .XEQ is in effect, in which case it is
terminated.  .XEQ may be nested 15 levels.
 
For MAnual only, if any line of extracted commentary ends in "~x", where "x" is
any character, that line will be excluded from the output if "x" appears in the
name of the file to which F$EXCLUDE is assigned.  If the excluded line is the
first of a packet, then the entire packet will be excluded.  In any case, the
"~x" is excluded from the output.  This feature is also available for
conditional .XEQ by spelling it
".XEQ~x comment-name".
