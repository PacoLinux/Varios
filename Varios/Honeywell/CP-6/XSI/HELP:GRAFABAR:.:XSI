GRAFABAR will create a one-page "bar chart" of the user-supplied input data.
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRAFABAR.X [input_file][ OVER graphics_file][,listing_file][(options)]
 
(at the moment, there are several incarnations of GRAFABAR in .X; GRAFABAR (for
the laserprinter), GRAFABARDEC (for the DECVT125 and DECVT241), GRAFABARTEK
(for 4010-compatibles), and GRAFABARDMP (for the HIDMP29).  Use the version
that matches the device you are using.)
 
where:
 
input_file     is a file of GRAFABAR input in the format described below.
[Default is to prompt for data from the terminal.] DCB is F$105.
 
graphics_file  is the place you want the graphics to go.  DCB is GRAPHICS00.
 
listing_file   is the place you want the GRAFABAR "LO" to go to.  If you're
reading an input_file from a file, you probably want to say NO for this.  DCB
is F$108.
 
options are:
               BORDER - to create a 5% border around your chart.
               FRAME  - to draw a "frame" around the active plotting area.
 
input_data is prompted for, but always in the same order:
 
 Title of chart (80 CHARS.)
 Horizontal axis title (40 CHARS.)
 Vertical axis title (40 CHARS.)
 Notation text for lower-right-hand corner (40 chars.)
 
At this point, data for each "bar" is accepted, each followed by a !EOD record
in XEQ files or files or, separated by pressing the ESCAPE key, then the F key
in an interactive timesharing session.
 
The "bar data" is an integer and an bar title separated by spaces:
 
 144  CORN
 155  PEAS
 199  TUNA
 
The "bar" titles can be up to twelve characters in length, but if you have a
lot of "bars" and you use a lot of long titles there is a good chance that some
of the titles will overlap. In general, if you can keep the titles down to five
characters you will never have any problems.  If you do use twelve character
titles, it is suggested that you keep the number of "bars" per chart down to
five to avoid overlap.
GRAFABAR uses the CP-6 DIGS graphics system, which is a separately priced
product.  If you don't have it, maybe you should!  It's not that expensive.
