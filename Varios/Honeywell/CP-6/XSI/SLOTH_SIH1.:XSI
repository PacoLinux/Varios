For HELP messages, type:
 
HELP (SLOTH.X) COMMANDS         For a brief description of all commands
.*R*
HELP (SLOTH.X) command          For help on a specific command.
.*K* COMMANDS
The following is a list of valid commands to SLOTH
 
.*R*
DISPLAY     Display the dump slot information
.*R*
RESET       Reset dump slot information and display new values
.*R*
TEST        Test what the dump slot information would be if reset
.*R*
PACK        Change the pack on which SLOTH works
.*R*
END         Exit SLOTH and release disk
.*K* DISPLAY
Syntax:
.*R*
DI/SPLAY [AL/L]
.*B*
Description:
.*R*
This command displays the dump slot information in the SAD.  If ALL is
specified, information from the recovery buffers of any relevant dump slots is
displayed.
.*K* RESET
Syntax:
.*R*
RESET [ { AL/L | SL/OTS | SC/OUNT } ]
.*B*
Description:
.*R*
This command resets selected portions of the dump slot information to known
(i.e. zero) values.  ALL (the default) means both SLOT information and  SCOUNT
information.  One or the other may be reset by using the appropriate option.
The new dump slot information is displayed after it is reset.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: The RESET command should only be used when other more
conventional (e.g. running RCVR2 online) means of clearing the dump slots have
failed.  It should only be necessary after the dump slot headers have been
fouled up by a hardware failure or the 35811 bug (which only comes into play
when the size (not number) of dumps is too big.)  Please do not abuse this
command, as it will make later analysis of the problem impossible.  RESET ALL
or RESET SCOUNT resets only the dump number to zero.  Any important 'current
letter' dumps should be renamed before issuing this command.
.*K* TEST
Syntax:
.*R*
TE/ST [ { AL/L | SL/OTS | SC/OUNT } ]
.*B*
Description:
.*R*
This command functions exactly like the RESET command, but the new information
