TERMITE sets command variables to current terminal attribute values.
TERMITE (TERMinal InTErrogator) is used to acquire terminal attribute settings
as IBEX command values.  This allows for IBEX "programs" that can make
decisions based on the setting of these values.
 
TERMITE is capable of setting command variables based on any currently defined
window.  The variables that are currently known are all those in the following
structures: VLP_TRMCTL, VLP_EDTCTL, VLP_WINDOW and VLP_TRMATTR.

!TERMITE.X [UCnn] (option,option ... [)]
UCnn - Is the window to use in setting the attributes.
 
option - Are the attributes whose values you want set.
Any elementary item that is contained in VLP_TRMCTL, VLP_EDTCTL, VLP_WINDOW or
VLP_TRMATTR can be specified as an option to TERMITE.  These correspond to the
attributes shows to you by the !T command of IBEX.  The same abbreviations that
IBEX uses are used by TERMITE.  The spelling of the command variable will be
exactly the same as the spelling you use to indicate it.  Thus if you
abbreviate WRAPPAGE to WRAP, you will get a command variable of WRAP set to the
appropriate value.
 
Wherever possible the minimum abbreviations used for the options are the same
as those used by IBEX.
