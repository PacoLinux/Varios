squares in the fourth.  If the degrees of freedom for error is zero, the error

the first dimension of the right argument and an error term given by the sum of
the main effect for the factor represented by the second dimension of the right

The right argument is a matrix with M+1 rows and N+1 columns.  The first M rows

column gives the unit cost of shipping between the Ith origin and Jth
destination.  The first M elements in the last column give the availabilities
at the M origins, and the first N elements in the last row give the
requirements at the N destinations.  The element in the lower right-hand corner
is arbitrary. In order to have an optimal solution the sum of the
availabilities must be equal to the sum of the requirements.  For brevity in
the documentation of other functions required by TRANS, this matrix matrix is
referred to as a "bordered cost matrix", and M and N will always refer to the
number of origins and number of destinations respectively.
 
 
The following information is given for an optimal (minimal) solution:
origin-destination pairs, amount shipped, unit costs and costs for each amount
shipped for routes in the optimal basic feasible solution; total cost of
shipment; optimal dual variables adjusted so that the minimum dual variable for
the origins is zero.  If the sum of the availabilities is not equal to the sum
of the requirements an indication is given and no solution is found.
