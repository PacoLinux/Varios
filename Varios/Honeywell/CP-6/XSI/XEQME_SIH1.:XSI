XEQME is a run unit that allows you to make a run unit out of an XEQ file.
.*B*
To use XEQME, put EDIT-style keys on your XEQ file, and copy XEQME INTO your
XEQ file with PCL...like so:
.*R*
 
!C MYXEQFILE OVER MYXEQFILE(LN)
.*R*
!C XEQME.X INTO MYXEQFILE
.*R*
..Copying
.*R*
 
Now, instead of saying
.*R*
!XEQ MYXEQFILE [xeq options or substitutions]
.*R*
 
You can just say:
.*R*
!MYXEQFILE. [xeq options or substitutions]
.*R*
 
Note that GLOBAL, DEFAULT, and command line string substitutions will be
effected, and that XEQ options like T, P, and NGSUBS will be honored.
