GRAFABAR3D creates a one-page three dimensional barchart of user-supplied input
data.
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRAFABAR3D.X [input_file][ OVER graphics_file][,listing_file][(options)]
 
(at the moment, there are two incarnations of GRAFABAR3D in .X; GRAFABAR3D (for
the QMS laserprinter), and GRAFABAR3DDIG (which creates DIGIS files).
 
where:
 
input_file     is a file of GRAFABAR3D input in the format described below.
[Default is to prompt for data from the terminal.] DCB is F$105.
 
graphics_file  is the place you want the graphics to go.  DCB is GRAPHICS00 for
GRAFABAR3D, and GRAPHICS01 for GRAFABAR3DDIG.
 
listing_file   is the place you want the GRAFABAR3D "LO" to go to.  If you're
reading an input_file from a file, you probably want to say NO for this.  DCB
is F$108.
 
options are:
               BORDER - to create a 5% border around your chart.
               FRAME  - to draw a "frame" around the active plotting area.
 
input_data is prompted for, always in the same order:
 
What is X-Y plane viewing angle (0-90,180-270)
What is elevation viewing angle (0-90)
What is plot title? (40 characters max)
What is lower right corner notation text? (40 chars.)
Input extra note text (for left-side) here; !EOD ends
Enter x-axis (right-side) titles one per line; a blank entry or !EOD
indicates\N.*R*\Nthe end of x-axis data
Enter y-axis (left-side) titles one per line; a blank entry or !EOD
indicates\N.*R*\Nthe end of y-axis data
Enter data for each bar in the form
x_label y_label value
 
At this point, data for each "bar" is accepted, followed by a !EOD record
 
The "bar data" is an X title, a Y title, and a positive integer separated by
spaces:
 
 PEAS JANUARY 100
 PEAS FEBRUARY 200
 BEANS JANUARY 15
 BEANS FEBRUARY 29
 
The bar titles can be up to 16 characters in length.  If you need special
characters or embedded spaces, the items must be in quotes:
 
 'SEP 86' CORN 190
 
GRAFABAR3D uses the CP-6 DIGS graphics system, which is a separately priced
product.  If you don't have it, maybe you should!  It's not that expensive.
