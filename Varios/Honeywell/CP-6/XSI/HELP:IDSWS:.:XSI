IDSWS.X
 
  This  APL  workspace  provides  access  to any IDS database for
which  there is  an accessible  APL subschema.   The user  is not
required to have knowledge of APL in order to use this workspace.
 
  Simple  commands  permit  the  subschema  to be opened, IDS DML
statements  may  be  executed,  and  the  values  of  items to be
displayed and modified.  Direct access to all of the standard IDS
registers such  as DBSTATUS and DBRECORD  is supplied.  The names
of  all  of  the   database  SETS,  REALMS,  RECORDS,  ITEMS  and
PARAMETERS  may be  displayed along  with their attributes.  This
workspace is designed primarily  for users that are interested in
navigating   through  a   database  interactively   and  are  not
necessarily APL programmers.

itemname=value (, itemname2=value2, ...)
 
  This command permits the value of  an item to be changed in the
UWA.   If the  value is  a text  string then  the string  must be
enclosed  within  quotes,  with  two  quotes  used to represent a
single  quote.   Numbers  are  entered  in  standard  APL numeric
representation.
 
 
EXAMPLE:
 
:PLAYER_NAME='GEORGE ARMSTRONG',PLAYER_NUMBER=15
 
  In  this example,  the items  PLAYER_NAME and PLAYER_NUMBER are
assigned.

Use $QXL in FIXTEXT to minimize workspace required.
03/11/86
Corrected example in HELP file.
Made 'PROMPT OFF' the default.
01/30/84
The handling of hyphen and underscore has been improved for users of
non-APL terminals.
09/07/83
The UTS displayed by the SUBSCHEMA command has been corrected.
 
The REPORT command has been significantly enhanced to provide optional
control over the inclusion of the database key, record name and
realmname.  A new report qualification has been added to permit fields
of records owned by the current record to be displayed.  The rules for
formatted output have been relaxed to provide formatted output whenever
all items to be displayed have format specifications.  Formatted fields
may be left justified in reports by setting their associated format
width specification negative.  (ie. a width of -10 reserves 10 positions
and left justifies the value in the 10 position field).
 
A new command called PROMPT is available.  This command provides the
ability to interactivly prompt novice users and provide lists of
alternatives and their meanings when this mode is activated.  This mode
requires considerably more CPU time and memory to execute in but is a
great learning tool.
 
The commands END and QUIT have been added to provide a command to exit
the APL program (but not APL).
 
Many bugs in the HELP command have been corrected to provide a facility
more like CP-6 HELP.
 
The RECSET command has been implemented to display the sets belonging to
a list of specified records.

  This command causes the specified  items to be displayed, or if
a  recordname  was  specified,  all  items within that record are
displayed.   The command  name is  not required  for this command
unless the name of the first record or item in the command is the
same as a unique abrieviation of a command name.

FORMAT itemname [width [,rightdigits]]
 
     This  command is used  to indicate the  number of columns to
allow for this item when it  is being formatted in a REPORT.  The
rightdigits  value  indicates  for  numeric  items  the number of
digits to display to the  right of the decimal point.  A negative
width  value  is  used  to  request  left justification of output
formatted by the REPORT command.
 
     If  width  and  rightdigits  are  obmitted, then the current
values  of  the  item  format  is  displayed.   In  this  mode, a
recordname may be  used in which case the formats  for all of the
items associated with that record are displayed.
 
 
Example:
 
:FORMAT TEAM_CITY 15, TEAM_NICKNAME 14, TEAM_TICKET_PRICE 8 2

HEADING item ['heading'] [,item ['heading']]
 
     This command  is used to specify column  headings to be used
by  the REPORT command.   The heading must  be enclosed in single
quotes  and  should  not  contain  quotes.   The  default heading
consists of the item name.  The current headings may be displayed
by  not specifying  replacement headings.   The headings  for all
items within  a record may be displayed  by specifying the record
name.

RECSET [recordname [,recordname]]
 
     This command displays five  columns of output, sorted in the
first column  by record name.  If no  record names are present in
the command,  then all records in the  database are assumed.  The
output contains in the first column, each record name, the second
column contains  the sets owned by this  record, the third column
contains the  sets in which this  record may be a  member and the
fourth  and fifth  columns indicate  membership status (AUTOMATIC
vrs MANUAL, OPTIONAL vrs MANDATORY).

REPORT [itemlist][recordlist] WITHIN {setname  }
                                     {realmname}
 
  This command will display the  contents of the records that are
in a particular set occurance,  or on records within a particular
realm.
 
 
  Reports are made by issuing the following IDS commands:
 
FIND FIRST <recordname> WITHIN <setname>
FIND NEXT  <recordname> WITHIN <setname>
FIND NEXT  <recordname> WITHIN <setname>
  .
  .
until the end of the set  or realm is reached.  After each record
is found, the items that were requested on the report command (or
all of the items if the record name was specified) are displayed.
 
  Control  over  the  placement  of  all  of  the  item values is
possible  by specifying  a field  width and  right digits via the
FORMAT  command.   If  a  non-zero  format width is available for
every item  to be displayed for this  record then the report will
be  formatted  such  that  each  item  will take up the number of
columns specified by the magnitude  of its format width, with two
blank  columns  separating  adjacent  values.   Items whose field
width  is negative will  be right justified  within the field and
positive  field  width  values   cause  this  value  to  be  left
justified.

Qualified report syntax:
 
REPORT itemsrecords,[items OWNER set] WITHIN SET;
      (itemsrecords,[items OWNER set] WITHIN SET)
 
  The keywords RECORD, REALM, and DBKEY are permitted as elements
of  the itemlist  to be  reported.  When  present, they cause the
name  of the  record, name  of the  realm and  database key to be
optionally displayed.
 
  Brackets  may be used  to include fields  from records that own
this  record  in  the  report  line.   For example, if the record
player  is owned by  the record PRIMARY_POSITION  through the set
PLAYER_POOL,  then the  field POSITION_NAME  may be included from
the  record PRIMARY_POSITION by  the qualification [POSITION_NAME
OWNER PLAYER_POOL] (HELP REPORT  BRACKET_EXAMPLE is an example of
this).
 
  Parenthesis  may be used  on this command  to report on records
that  are  owned  by  records  that  are being found.  Entire new
report   commands  may   appear  within   parenthesis  and  these
parenthesised report commands may themselves contain parenthesis.
 
 
     This  example  uses  brackets  to  obtain  the  name  of the
PLAYER's position from the set PLAYER_POOL.
