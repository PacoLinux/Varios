Input must be in the form of ASM6502-formatted records.  That is, each
record is in the general format of
 
    :aabbbbcc[dd]...ee
 
where
 
    :   is a re-sync character beginning each record.
    aa  is the count of the number of dd bytes in the record, in
        "printable hex" (see below).
  bbbb  is an address field, MSB first.
    cc  is the record type.
    dd  are data bytes, depending on the record type.
    ee  is the record checksum, computed by forming the arithmetic
        inverse of the arithmetic sum of all the (hexadecimal) bytes
        in the record, aa through dd.  Thus, the sum of all the
        previous bytes is zero, modulo 256, when added to ee.
 
"printable hex" consists of two characters, '0'-'9' and 'A'-'F', for
each internal byte of data.  The characters may be in ASCII or EBCDIC
depending on the host's character set.
 
To use MSA6502:
 
    !MSA6502.Z source OVER output
 
where "source" defines the 6502 object unit file and "output" defines
the reverse-assembled source file.  "OVER" is required.  MSA6502 works
in three phases:
 
    Phase 1 reads the "source" file and stores the information in
    simulated 6502 memory.  64K bytes are reserved for this memory.
    Only record types 00/10 (data), 01/11 (entry), 05/15 (memory
    reserve), and 80-82 (symbol table information) are processed.
    Relocation information records are ignored.  Input may also be
    in an alternate form consisting of records containing "printable
    hex" characters keyed with an EDIT key whose integral value is
    the location of the first byte of the record in memory.  Any
    error during Phase 1 causes the run to be aborted.
 
    Phase 2 prompts the user for entry points into the program just
    loaded.  If an entry type record (01/11) was found in the input
    file, that chain has already been chased.  Commands are of the
    form
 
        Jxxxx
        Bxxxx
 
    where "J" specifies that a JSR (subroutine jump) is to be made
    to "xxxx", where "xxxx" is a one-to-four nibble hexadecimal
    address.  "B" specifies that a Bxx (branch) is to be made to
    "xxxx".  MSA6502 will enter the instruction sequence at the
    location specified and trace instructions until a terminating
    condition is encountered.  Terminating conditions include
 
    1.  Execution of any RTI, RTS, indirect JMP, or illegal
        instruction.
 
    2.  Execution of any instruction which has already been visited.
 
    3.  Execution of any instruction which is in the middle of
        another instruction.
 
    Unconditional branches and jumps are "taken"; that is, tracing
    automatically restarts at the destination address.  When a
    terminating condition is encountered, Phase 2 initiates a scan
    of all of memory for an instruction that has been tagged as the
    target of a branch or call instruction which has not been
    visited.  Tracing automatically resumes at that point.  When
    there are no more untraced threads, control returns to the user
    for another entry.
 
    At the end of each segment trace, Phase 2 prints a status message
    in the form
 
        nnn byte(s) out of mmmm accounted for (zz%)
 
    where "mmmm" indicates the total number of bytes loaded from the
    input file (including reserve-memory bytes), and "nnn" indicates
    the number of instruction bytes that have been visited.  "zz" is
    the percentage of "mmmm" that "nnn" represents.
 
    During Phase 2 the user may also enter the command Pxxxx, which
    will cause Phase 2 to print a summary of the areas of memory
    which have been decoded.  The display takes the form of
 
        $xxxx-$yyyy type
 
    "xxxx" and "yyyy" are (inclusive) brackets for the type of memory
    defined by "type".  "type" may be "Data" or "Instructions".
    Memory which has had no data stored into it from Phase 1 is not
    listed.  This list may be lengthy; the user may bracket the
    display by specifying a start address in the P command ("xxxx")
    and he may use the BREAK key to stop the display.
 
    Two other commands which can be used during Phase 2 to assist in
    the tracing process are Mxxxx and Dxxxx.  Both produce the same
    output; however, M directs the output to the user's terminal while
    D directs it to the output file.  The output is a formatted dump
    of memory, beginning with "xxxx" (0 if not specified).  Memory
    which has not been loded during phase 1 is not dumped.  the dump
    takes the format
 
        llll xxxxxxxx oooooooo ffffffff cccccccc
 
    Eight bytes are dumped per line.  "llll" is the address of the
    first byte position (regardless of whether one is printed there or
    not), and it will always be a multiple of 8.  "xxxxxxxx" is the
    hexadecimal representation of the eight bytes.  "oooooooo" is an
    interpretation of the byte as an opcode.  "ffffffff" are the MSA
    access flags, Read=8, Write=4, JSR=2, and Bxx=1.  Finally,
    "cccccccc" is the ASCII interpretation of the bytes, with
    unprintable characters replaced by periods.  The user may
    interrupt an online Mxxxx command by hitting the BREAK key.
 
    When the user is satisfied with the extent of the tracing process,
    he enters the END command to enter Phase 3 to produce the output
    file.  If no END command is entered, no output file is built;
    however, any pre-existing file of the same name will be deleted.
    Control returns to the Phase 2 prompt when this is completed.  The
    user may enter more tracing commands, if desired, and issue the
    END command again; this will append another copy of the reverse-
    assembled program onto the end of the output file.
 
    When the user wishes to end the session, QUIT is entered.  The
    output file will be closed and saved.
Output consists of a Edit-keyed file of "source" commands, each of
which is 80 bytes.  The output may be used as input to ASM6502, often
without modification.
