A       This  manual describes  how to  use the  PULSE screen  editor.  PULSE is
A       designed  to be  terminal independent  and fairly  flexible.  The manual
A       contains  information  on  starting  the  editor  and  using the various
A       commands  and  features  available  in  a  screen editor.  The manual is
A       broken  down into sections  summarizing and describing  the commands and
A       explaining the functionality of PULSE.
A 
A       This manual was prepared using the PULSE screen editor.

A                              Notation Conventions Table
A 
A       Notation     Description
A 
A       Lowercase Letters
A 
A                    Lowercase letters indicate that the element is a
A                    variable, to be replaced with the desired value from
A                    an accompanying list.
A 
A 
A       CAPITAL LETTERS
A 
A                    Capital letters indicate a literal, to be entered as
A                    shown.
A 
A 
A       Brackets
A 
A                    An element inside brackets is optional.  When used to
A                    enclose portions of keywords, brackets signify that the
A                    bracketed portion may be omitted, or truncated at any
A                    point.
A 
A 
A       Braces
A 
A                    Elements placed within braces signify a required
A                    choice.  For instance,  {ON|TO|INTO|OVER}  indicates
A                    that a choice must be made from one of the four
A                    keywords separated by  OR  bars.

A       OR Bar
A 
A                    The OR bar separates elements in a list from which one
A                    element may be or must be chosen.
A 
A 
A       Letters preceded by a carat
A 
A                    Letters preceded by a carat indicate that the control
A                    key should be held down at the same time as the key
A                    denoted by the letter.  i.e.   K indicates that the
A                    control and K keys be held down at the same time.

A 
A 
A                                                                    USING PULSE
A 
A 
A 
A 
A 
A       PULSE  is a  Pretty Useful  Little Screen  Editor.  In  order to use the
A       screen editor,  the user must be logged  onto a correctly profiled video
A       terminal (CRT).   The terminal must also have  the proper screen editing
A       attributes defined  in its profile.  PULSE, and  any other screen editor
A       for that matter, cannot function  on a hardcopy device.  For information
A       on  using  CP-6  terminal  profiles,  see  the CP-6 Programmer Reference
A       Manual (CE40).
A 
A 
A       To start the PULSE editor from IBEX, type:
A 
A             !PULSE [fid  [( options [)]]]
A 
A       Parameters:
A           fid      is the CP-6 file identifier of the file you wish to
A                    edit.
A 
A           options  are a list of one or more PULSE command options.
A                    Available options can be seen in the OPTIONS section.
A 
A 
A       When  PULSE starts  up, it  will clear  the display  window and  place a
A       status bar at  the top of the window.  The  status bar contains the name
A       of the file  being edited and will be used  to prompt for user responses
A       in  conjunction with  certain commands.   If fid  is not  specified, the
A       status  bar will contain  the string 'No  file open.' In  this case, the
A       user will be placed in a command window where a file may be selected.
A 
A       If  fid exists,  then PULSE  will open  the file  and display  the first
A       several lines of text for you.  If fid does not exist, PULSE will create
A       a  new file  for you  with the  name fid.   PULSE will only create keyed
A       files, but it can perform limited modifications on consecutive files, as
A       well as examine them in READ ONLY mode.
A 
A       If  the  user  specifies  a  file  that  cannot  be  updated, PULSE will
A       automatically  open  the  file  READ  ONLY  and inform the user of this,
A       whether that option was specified or not.  The minimum access attributes
A       necessary for a file to be open for update are DelR, WNew, Upd and Read.
A       DelF access  is not necessary, but  if it is present  on the file, PULSE
A       will perform several of its functions in a much more efficient manner.

A       The commands are based on control  codes issued by the user.  The screen
A       editor  allows you  to insert  and delete  lines in  a file,  as well as
A       modify  them, while the  screen displays the  context of the surrounding
A       lines in  the file.  Positioning of  the cursor is done  either with the
A       arrow  keys, or by  issuing the appropriate  commands.  For a summary of

A       PULSE  maintains  EDIT  compatible  keys  for  the  file  being  edited.
A       Periodically, if  there is no room  to insert a record,  PULSE will tell
A       you to wait  while it makes more room for  your new records.  The amount
A       of time  you must wait depends,  partially, on the size  of the file and
A       the current fragmentation of keys within the file.
A 
A       PULSE also makes  use of context files to describe  the type of terminal
A       being  used for  screen editing.   See the  CONTEXT FILES  section for a
A       description of how these work.

A       Blocks
A 
A 
A       In  addition to  working with  individual lines  and sections  of lines,
A       PULSE can also perform several commands on blocks.  A block is a section
A       of the document currently being edited.   A block may be part of a line,
A       several lines, or the entire file.   The limits of the block are defined
A       by  a beginning  marker and  an end  marker.  Blocks  allow the  user to
A       manipulate a large section of a  document all at once, without having to
A       repeat  several simple  operations on  a line  by line basis.  The block
A       commands include marking and unmarking  a block, copying a block, moving
A       a block,  deleting a block, and  transferring a block to  and from disk.
A       Once marked, a block is  defined until the user specifically unmarks it,
A       deletes the block, moves it, closes the file, or exits the editor.

A       Active Files
A 
A 
A       PULSE maintains a list of  active files during an editing session.  When
A       you use  the command window to  select another file to  edit, PULSE will
A       store the context of your current  file (i.e.  the position you last had
A       in the file, your block and  spot marks, and the settings of the various
A       PULSE  flags and output  controls).  PULSE will  then open the new file.
A       At any  time, you can use  the NEXT or PREVIOUS  commands in the command
A       window  to  go  back  to  your  place  in  one of the files you had been
A       editing.  For more information on how the commands in the command window
A       affect the active file list, see the ENTERING THE COMMAND WINDOW section
A       in this manual.

A       Work file syntax
A 
A 
A           W[ORK]
A 
A            The WORK file option causes PULSE to open a temporary work file for
A            you  to edit;  any changes  made do  not affect your original file.
A            When you  finish with a work  file by exiting PULSE  or closing the
A            file, you will  be asked if you wish to save  your file and its new
A            changes.  The file will be saved  unless you hit N or n in response
A            to  the question.   If the  work file  is to  be saved,  PULSE will
A            prompt for a file name.  Hit  the <CR> key if you want to overwrite
A            the original.  If you wish to  create a new file, enter the name of
A            the  file you wish  to create.  If  the file does  not exist, PULSE
A            will create it for you.  If  the file does exist, PULSE will ask if
A            you wish to overwrite the existing  file.  Respond Y, N, or Q.  A Y
A            response  will overwrite the  existing file; N  will cause PULSE to
A            prompt  you  for  an  alternate  file  name;  Q will cause PULSE to
A            continue  closing  the  work  file  without saving the changes.  If
A            PULSE is  attempting to open a  work copy for a  file that does not
A            exist, PULSE  will create an empty  work file and tell  you that it
A            has  created  a  new  file.   When  closing  the  work file, a <CR>
A            response will  tell PULSE to save  the work file with  the name you
A            specified  on the  edit command.   Also, <ESC>  <D> will recall the
A            original file name at the prompt.
A 
A            The shortest form of the WORK command is W.
A 
A            NOTE:   Saving your context  with the SAVE  command when work files
A            are  present  is  not  a  very  good  idea.   If  you  do  SAVE and
A            subsequently log  off the system, a RESTORE  command will be unable
A            to  locate the work  copies of your  file.  For this  reason, it is
A            recommended  that  you  save  your  work  files  with the TRANSFORM
A            command prior to saving your context.

A            can be overridden by using the USEWORKFILES command in your context

A       Encryption syntax

A           CR[PT] [=] seed      where seed is an octal encryption code in the
A                                range 1 to 777777777777.
A 
A            The CRPT option tells PULSE to  open the specified file and use the
A            specified  seed for  all I/O  to that  file.  Any work file created
A            from an encrypted  file and saved over a new  file will inherit the
A            encryption  seed from the  original file.  Also,  if you specify an
A            incorrect encryption seed, PULSE may be unable to handle your file.
A            In  that case,  PULSE will  report the  error, close  the file, and
A            place  the cursor in  the command window.   The seed will remain in
A            effect throughout the file.
A 
A            NOTE:  While  you can use different seeds  in your file by changing
A            the seed with an option on  the EDIT command in the command window,
A            it  is not  a good  idea to  do so.   Different seeds for different
A            records within  the file does not generally  make sense in a screen
A            editing  environment.  Consequently, if  your file already utilizes
A            multiple seeds, you should use a different editor.
A 
A            NOTE:   A  SAVEd  context  does  not  contain  the seed used for an
A            encrypted file.   Instead, when restoring a  context with encrypted
A            files in  it, PULSE will prompt  for the seed to  use on that file.
A            If you have  since removed the encryption from the  file, a seed of
A            zero (0) tells PULSE not to use encryption on that file.

A 
A 
A 
A 
A 
A       In order  for PULSE to be  terminal independent, it needs  to know about
A       the terminal  that is being used. Information  for the various terminals
A       available on the system is stored in context files. These files actually
A       have two parts; an IMP object unit and a set of PULSE commands.  The IMP
A       object  unit  can  be  created  with  the  IMP  processor  on  CP-6. For
A       information  on  using  IMP  to  define  keys,  see  the CP-6 Programmer
A       Reference  Manual (CE40).  The second  part of  the file  can be created
A       using  any text  editor on  CP-6. There  are currently  16 special PULSE
A       commands.  They are:
A 
A            WordWrapClm, OverStrike, Insert, HScroll, StripBlanks, TextEdit
A            EasyAppend, RcrWrap, KeepNewEmpty, UseWorkFiles, Tabs, Type,
A            Start, Finish, CmdOpen and CmdClose
A 
A       These commands, with the  exception of KeepNewEmpty, UseWorkFiles, Tabs,
A       Type,  Start,  Finish,  CmdOpen  and  CmdClose  are  normally done as ^O
A       commands, so for descriptions of what these commands do, see the command
A       summary.  The KeepNewEmpty command  is only available within the context
A       file.  KeepNewEmpty normally defaults  to YES.  When KeepNewEmpty is NO,
A       files newly created with PULSE that are empty (zero records) at the time
A       you   exit,  close   the  file,   or  switch   files  will  be  deleted,
A       automatically.  YES causes these files to be preserved. The UseWorkFiles
A       command is also only available  in the context file.  UseWorkFiles, when
A       YES, tells  PULSE that it should  always use a work  file when editing a
A       file.   The  default  is  NO.  Tabs  and  Type  are normally used in the
A       COMMAND_WINDOW, so see that topic for more details.  It should be noted,
A       however, that specifying TABS without any parameters in the context file
A       will have no effect.
A 
A       The Start, Finish, CmdOpen and CmdClose commands are all used to specify
A       strings that should be sent to the terminal at various times.  The Start
A       string is  sent when PULSE is  first entered. The Finish  string is sent
A       when PULSE exits.  CmdOpen is sent when any window aside from the Screen
A       Edit  window is  accessed, and  CmdClose is  sent when  returning to the
A       Screen  Edit window.   One use  for these  last two commands is toggling
A       application keypad mode on terminals which provide this feature. Nothing
A       will be sent to the terminal for an undefined string.
A 
A       The syntax for specifying these commands in a context file is:

A            character strings enclosed in single quotes.  For example:
A 
A            Start=ESC,'[?5h'
A            Finish=ESC,'[?5l'
A 
A            would send the sequence telling  a VT200 to use black characters on
A            a  white background.   The accompanying  Finish string would return
A            the terminal to white on black when PULSE exits.
A 
A       Users  may create  their own  context files  using the  following set of
A       commands:
A 
A       !IMP impsource {ON|OVER|TO|INTO} impou
A       !COPY impou,pulsesource {ON|OVER|TO|INTO} :PULSE_profile
A 
A       where impsource  is a file containing IMP  key definitions, impou is the
A       resulting  file  from  IMP,  pulsesource  is  a  file  containing  PULSE
A       commands, and profile is the profile name for which this context file is
A       being made.
A 
A       When PULSE first starts up,  it loads a standard context file containing
A       the key definitions for delete line (^Y) and the BREAK key (to go to the
A       commandwindow).  This file is called :PULSE_STANDARD.  After loading the
A       STANDARD  context  file,  PULSE  looks  for  a context file matching the
A       user's  current profile.  This  file should contain  key definitions for
A       the arrow keys, the restore-line key, and any special PULSE commands the
A       user desires.  It should be  noted, however, that the ^Y command (Delete
A       Line) is already accomplished with  an IMP sequence equivalent to ESC ^L
A       (Escape Formfeed).   So, if the user wishes  to use a different sequence
A       to delete lines, that sequence should be IMPed to ESC ^L.

A 
A       A user  defined context file for a  profile should contain the sequences
A       sent by the arrow keys and define them such that the up arrow sends 'ESC
A       A', down arrow sends 'ESC B', right arrow sends ^R, and left arrow sends
A       ^H (backspace).  The restore-line key  is obtained by IMPing a keystroke
A       to  be  'ESC  P'.   The  context  file  may  also  contain any other key
A       definitions  that   the  user  may  desire   for  special,  personalized
A       functionality.
A 
A       PULSE will look for files starting  with :PULSE_ and ending in a profile
A       name.  i.e. if the user's profile  is DECVT100, the editor will look for
A       :PULSE_DECVT100.  If it cannot find  that context file, it will look for
A       :PULSE_IMP as a standard, profile independent context file.
A 
A       For  both the  STANDARD and  profile context  files, PULSE will search a
A       certain set of accounts for  these files.  First, for the STANDARD file,
A       PULSE will check for  a 'PULSE_Standard' command variable.  This command
A       variable  may contain  the name  of the  account that  the user wants to
A       contain the :PULSE_STANDARD context  file.  The specified account may be
A       any account listed in the Master  Account Directory, or on the same disk
A       pack  as the user's  default directory.  The  user may use the following
A       command in his SETUP file to  tell PULSE to always look for the STANDARD
A       context file in the USER directory first:
A 
A          !Let PULSE_Standard='USER'
A 
A       If  there  is  no  command  variable,  or PULSE cannot find the STANDARD
A       context file in the specified account,  it will look in the user's logon
A       directory.  If it still cannot find the context file, PULSE will look in
A       the .:LIBRARY account, and then in the account where PULSE is installed.
A 
A       Likewise, for the profile search account, there may be a 'PULSE_Profile'
A       command  variable.   PULSE  will  look  for  the  :PULSE_profile and the
A       :PULSE_IMP  files  in  the  account  specified  in the command variable.
A       Failing to find either of those  files, PULSE will look for the same two
A       file  names  in  the  user's  logon  directory, and then in the :LIBRARY
A       account.   Finally,  if  PULSE  still  cannot  find  the  context  files
A       necessary,  it will  search the  account where  PULSE is installed.  The
A       following command may  be placed in the user's SETUP  file to tell PULSE
A       to look in the USER directory for the profile context files first:
A 
A          !Let PULSE_Profile='USER'
A 
A       There is also a third context file  that PULSE can use.  If the user has
A       defined  a command  variable named  PULSE_Name, PULSE  will use the file
A       :PULSE_  combined  with  the  contents  of  that  variable to produce an
A       additional  context  file.   For  example,  if  a  user  has defined his
A       variable as follows:
A 
A          !Let PULSE_Name='BLIP'
A 
A       PULSE will  search for the context file  named :PULSE_BLIP in the search
A       directories described above.

A 
A 
A       Finally,  if the context  file introducer :PULSE_  is unsuitable for any
A       reason, the  command variable PULSE_Prefix can substitute  a new one, up
A       to  20  characters  long.   This  substitution  will  take place for all
A       context files.  For example:
A 
A          !Let PULSE_Prefix=':LADC_'
A 
A       PULSE will look for context files such as :LADC_STANDARD, :LADC_profile,
A       and :LADC_IMP.
A 
A       NOTE:   The  arrow  keys  on  some  terminals may send a special control
A       character  that  is  normally  used  by  PULSE.  For instance, Televideo
A       terminals use the ^K and ^L characters for two of their arrow keys.  The
A       system  context file  for these  terminals defines  these as being arrow
A       keys, and subsequently re-defines two other keys, ^D and ^F as being the
A       ^K and ^L  command keys, respectively.  The user may  set up his context
A       file in any manner he so desires as far as which keystrokes will provide
A       which function.
A 
A       NOTE:  If the user decides to  use his own :PULSE_STANDARD file in place
A       of the system defined file, the following points should be kept in mind.
A       The  system STANDARD  file defines  ^Y to  be ESC  FF (^L or Form Feed),
A       which is the  CP-6 method of deleting a line  in a screen editor.  Also,
A       the system STANDARD file defines the BREAK key to be the ^C H command to
A       get  to the command  window.  Finally, the  system STANDARD file deletes
A       all inherited IMPs that came from the IBEX window.

A            The  EDIT command will  select a new  file for PULSE  to edit.  The
A            available  options  can  be  seen  under  the OPTIONS section.  The
A            context of the current file will  be saved to the active file list,
A            and the new file will be opened.
A 
A            If  the  specified  fid  is  already  in  the active file list, the
A            context from the active file list will be restored.
A 
A            If the specified  fid exists, but is not in  the active list, PULSE
A            will open  the file.  If the specified  fid does not already exist,
A            PULSE will create a new one.   If the user is not allowed to change
A            the file, or specifies the  EXAMINE option, the file will be opened
A            as READ ONLY.   The context for the new file  will be placed in the
A            active list  immediately after the context of  the current file and
A            before the  context of any file  that may have already  been in the
A            list following the current file.
A 
A            If the  + and - variations  of the EDIT command  are used, then the
A            file relative to  the current one is open.  If  the EDIT command is
A            issued alone, then it just returns to the current file.
A 
A            If  new options  are specified  along with  the EDIT command for an
A            already open file, then those options will take effect immediately.
A            However,  it is not  a good idea  to fool around  with changing the
A            CRPT option with a file that is already open.

A                         file list.
A 
A            The DELETE  command is used to close  the currently active file and
A            delete  it.  Like  the close  command, the  user may also close and
A            delete  a  file  offset  by  +  or  -  num  , or delete it by name.
A            Verification is  required, so the user must  type "YES" in order to
A            have the deletion take place.  Nothing will happen if the user does
A            not  type "YES".  If  the specified file  is associated with a work
A            file,  only the work  copy of the  file will be  destroyed.  If the
A            file  is associated  with any  other kind  of file  (including READ
A            ONLY), the  deletion may still occur if  the user confirms and also
A            has access permission to delete  the file.  The DELETE command also
A            removes the specified file from the active file list.

A       List
A 
A 
A            L[IST]
A 
A            The  LIST command will  list all currently  open files.  Before the
A            name  of each  file, PULSE  will put  a +  or -  sign, along with a
A            number  to  indicate  the  relative  offset from the currently open
A            file.   PULSE places only  a plus or  minus sign next  to the files
A            immediately  adjacent to the  current file, and  an => sign next to
A            the  current file.   The user  may type  in whatever symbol appears
A            next  to  a  filename  to  go  immediately  to  that file (with the
A            exception  of  the  =>  sign,  which  is  not a valid command).  In
A            addition,  PULSE will place  an access type  identifier next to the
A            filename  to describe  the file.   A "c"  indicates that the listed
A            file is a consecutive file, an "r" indicates that file is opened in
A            Read Only mode, and a "w" indicates that the file is being accessed

A 
A            SAVE {ON|TO|OVER} filename
A 
A            The SAVE command will save the complete current context of all your
A            currently open files, including  your current search parameters and
A            internal  temporary buffer, in  the specified filename.   ON and TO
A            specify  file creation  and will  report an  error if the specified
A            file  already exists.   OVER specifies  file replacement,  and will
A            always create a new save file.
A 
A            If  there are  any work  files in  the current  context, PULSE will
A            print  a warning  and the  names of  all currently open work files.
A            The  warning states  that if  the user  logs off before restoring a
A            context  with work  files, the  work files  will not  be able to be
A            restored with the rest of  the context.  It is strongly recommended
A            that  the user  use the  TRANSFORM command  before saving a context
A            with work files in it.  A  context with STAR (*) files can never be
A            restored completely accurately after the user has logged off.

A            context.  If there had been  work files in the restored context and

A            restore those work files.  If  there were any encrypted files among

A       Saving a Block to the Temporary Buffer
A

A 
A            PULSE will transfer a copy of the currently selected block to a
A            temporary buffer.  No changes are made to the currently active
A            file.  No subsequent changes to the file will affect the contents
A            of the save buffer.  If a block had already been saved in the

A            is reached, the cursor will continue on the next or previous line.
A            The default is ON.

A 
A 
A 
A       This section  shows the escape sequences which  are standard on the CP-6
A       system and  are also useful in a  screen editing environment.  There are
A       additional  escape sequences available  and information on  these can be
A       obtained from the CP-6 Programmer Reference Manual (CE40).
A 
A       The information is ordered into two columns as shown below:
A 
A         Sequence   Function
A 
A       <UpArrow>
A                    Causes  the cursor  to move  up one  line on the screen.  A
A                    context file  for a specific terminal  should define the up
A                    arrow key to send an <ESC> <A>.
A 
A       <DownArrow>
A                    Causes the  cursor to move down one  line on the screen.  A
A                    context file for a specific terminal should define the down
A                    arrow key to send an <ESC> <B>.
A 
A       <RightArrow>
A                    Causes  the cursor to  move one column  to the right on the
A                    screen.   A  context  file  for  a specific terminal should
A                    define the right arrow key to send <^R>.
A 
A       <LeftArrow>
A                    Causes  the cursor  to move  one column  to the left on the
A                    screen.   A  context  file  for  a specific terminal should
A                    define the left arrow key to send <BS>.
A 
A       <ESC> <A>
A                    Causes  the cursor  to move  up one  line on the screen.  A
A                    context file  for a specific terminal  should define the up
A                    arrow key to send an <ESC> <A>.
A 
A       <ESC> <B>
A                    Causes the  cursor to move down one  line on the screen.  A
A                    context file for a specific terminal should define the down
A                    arrow key to send an <ESC> <B>.

A 
A       <ESC> <I>
A                    Simulates  a horizontal tab  moving the cursor  to the next
A                    input  tab stop.  If  the stop is  outside of the insertion
A                    window, the insertion window is reset.
A 
A       <ESC> <J>
A                    Toggles  setting  or  activation  of  the insertion window.
A                    Sets  the  left  and  right  limit of the insertion window.
A                    Note:   <ESC> <J> is  equivalent to <ESC>  <<> <ESC> <>> or
A                    <ESC> <R>, whichever toggles the insertion window.
A 
A       <ESC> <K>
A                    Deletes from the current edit point to the right end of the
A                    insertion window.
A 
A       <ESC><CNTL-K>
A                    Deletes to the left end of the insertion window.
A 
A       <ESC> <M>
A                    Resets   overstrike    and   insertion   modes,   disabling
A                    overstriking.  See <ESC> <O> and <ESC> <'>.
A 
A       <ESC> <N>
A                    Positions to the right limit of the insertion window unless
A                    the edit  point is already there.  In  this case, <ESC> <N>
A                    resets the insertion window first.
A 
A       <ESC> <O>
A                    Sets  overstrike (as  opposed to  replacement or insertion)
A                    mode  for input.   When on,  typing on  top of  an existing
A                    character  creates  an  input  record  that  contains  both
A                    characters, separated by a backspace character.
A 
A       <ESC> <R>
A                    Retypes the current input record.  Resets both the left and
A                    right  limits of the  insertion window to  frame the entire
A                    record.
A 
A       <ESC><CNTL-R>
A                    Same as <ESC><R>, except no retype occurs.
A 
A       <ESC> <V>
A                    <ESC> <V> are the first two characters of a three character
A                    sequence  in  which  the  third  character  is  to act as a
A                    criterion  for  a  search  of  the  input record within the
A                    insertion  window.   If  the  character  is  located in the
A                    window,  the  edit  point  is  moved  to that column,.  The
A                    direction of  the search is set  by the last-received <ESC>
A                    <V>,  <BS>, or <CNTL-R>.   <ESC> <V> sets  the direction to
A                    the direction moved during the last successful search.
A 
A       <ESC> <X>
A                    Deletes the current input record.

A 
A       <ESC> <CR>
A                    Moves  the edit  point to  the left  limit of the insertion
A                    window,  unless the edit  point is already  there.  In this
A                    case, <ESC><CR> resets the insertion window first.
A 
A       <ESC> <DEL>
A                    Delete  the character  to the  left of  the cursor.  If the
