SPY displays certain information about the users on a CP-6 system for users
with SPCLMM privilege.
SPY is invoked with the command:
 !SPY.:SYS [options]

Otherwise any ONE of the following options may be specified.
 
*{'B/ATCH'|'O/NLINE'|'G/HOST'|'T/P'}*
 
Display only users in the specified modes.  This is a repitition of a reducing
node (that means !SPY BOGT is legal, as is !SPY BG, etc.)
 
 
n[,n ...]
 
Display only users with the speicifed SYSIDs.  Each 'n' is a decimal number.
 
 
.n[,.n ...]
 
Display only users with the specified user numbers.  Each 'n' is an octal
number.
 
 
A/CCOUNT=symbol[,symbol ...]
 
Display only users with the specified accounts.
 
 
J/OBNAME=jobname[,jobname,...]
 
Display only users with the specified JOBNAMEs.  Each "jobname" may
be a legal CP-6 job name, or an arbitrary string enclosed in single
quotes.
 
 
@symbol[,symbol ...]
 
Displays users at the specified Workstation Of Origin (WOO.)
 
 
 
C/CBUF=string[,string ...]
 
Display only users whose CCBUF matches one of the specified strings.  If a
string is to contain a comma or right parenthisis it must be enclosed in single
quotes.
 
 
F/EP=n[,n ...]
 
Display only users on the specified FEPs.  Each 'n' is a decimal number.
 
 
L/INE=n-xxxx[,n-xxxx ...]
 
Display only users on the specified lines.  Each 'n' is a decimal number.  Each
'xxxx' is a hexidecimal number.
 
Names, accounts, jobnames, WOO's and CCBUF strings may contain the wildcard
character '?' which will match any substring.
 
AS/AVED
 
Display the users who have an ASAVEd image on the system.  These users will be
flaged by having an "*" instead of a "-" in their line number.

Display all of the users on the system (Ghost, Online, Batch, and TP).
 
Examples:
 
 
 !SPY ACCOUNT=:SYS,?HOST         "ACCOUNT SELECTION
 !SPY CCBUF=PL6?,SPY?BATCH?      "CCBUF SELECTION
 !SPY 123,456,789                "SYSID SELECTION
