REVLIST makes a list of people who have contributed to a review.
REVLIST is used to make a MAIL command that defines the people who are either
on the initial reviewers list, or have contributed to the review.  This list
can then be used to send out announcements (like meetings, cnacellations or
closures).
 
Syntax:
 
    !REVLIST.X fid [ [ON|OVER|INTO] result_fid ]
 
The fid identifies a "review file".  Assuming the fid is "x.y" REVLIST will
attempt to open permutations of the specification in the same manner as CRF.X.
That is:
    1) x.y
    2) x.:REVIEWS
    3) REV_x.:REVIEWS
Help file for: REVLIST.X
