                           MABLE7 and MABLE9
                           ------ --- ------
 
    The block letter routines used by BANNER are available as
subroutines to anyone who may want to use them.  The object units are
MABLE7.X and MABLE9.X.  MABLE7 builds 7-space high characters
(with one space between characters) and MABLE9 builds 9-space
characters.
 
    The MABLE routines build n-character block letters from a user CALL,
one line at a time.  The user specifies the source string of ASCII
characters and a destination area.  One blank is placed between each
expanded letter.  The calling sequence is:
 
        CALL MABLEn (num,src,slen,dst,dlen) [ALTRET(label)];
 
    The arguments are:
 
    n - is either 7 or 9, depending on the size letters desired (CALL
        MABLE7 or CALL MABLE9).
 
    num - is the line number to build, range 0-(n-1).
 
    src - is the source string, a CHAR element.
 
    slen - is the length of SRC in 9-bit characters, UBIN WORD.
 
    dst - is the destination string, a CHAR element.
 
    dlen - is the returned length of DST, UBIN word.
 
    The user calls MABLE7 seven times, once per line of block letters
(MABLE9 gets called nine times).  The returned string may be printed (by
the user) or stowed for later printing.
NUM may run from 0 to (n-1) or
(n-1) to 0 or in any other pattern; changing the contents of the source
string between MABLEn calls is not recommended.
 
    MABLEn ALTRETs only if NUM exceeds (n-1) and it does so only after
the output area is cleared to blanks.  It is useful, therefore, to allow
a program loop to call MABLEn with NUM values from zero to n, providing
a blank line to print after the last character line and an automatic
branch out of the loop.
