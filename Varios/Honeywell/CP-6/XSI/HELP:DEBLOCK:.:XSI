A long time ago, on an operating system far, far away, there lived a Peripheral
Conversion Language (a PCL!) that would deblock both tape files and disk files.
Now that a new galactic operating system is in power, the PCL can't deblock
disk files.  (It doesn't NEED it, because the real blocked media, tape, can be
deblocked by the tape file management of CP-6.)  Unfortunately, if you're
playing with tapes created by the OLD Empire (IBM), you sometimes find it
easier and more desirable to play with disk files of these menacing tapes.
 
Enter DEBLOCK.X.
