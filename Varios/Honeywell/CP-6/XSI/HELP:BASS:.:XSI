    The BASS (Batch And Symbiont Spy) processor looks at symbiont files in the
act of or waiting to PRINT, BEAM, PUNCH or whatever.  What a user may examine
depends on what privileges that user is authorized.  At the very least, the
user may look at their output (that is, output created by their current logon
account).  If the user has either FMREAD and/or FMSEC privilege, they may look
at anyones output.  If the user has DISPJOB, FMREAD and/or FMSEC then they may
LIST anyones output.  The LIST command returns certain information about the
output but doesn't allow the user (if they only have DISPJOB) to actually
examine the output.
 BASS may be invoked as follows:
  !BASS [cmd-file] [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO},listing] [( [cmds] [)]]
 where:
  cmd-file  is a file containing BASS command(s) (default is ME)
  listing   is where BASS's primary output will be directed (default is ME)
  cmds      is one or more BASS commands, separated by semi-colons.  If nothing
            follows the '(', then a 'List .' command is the default.
In the list of TOPICS below, characters following the slash(/) are optional:
 
?         EX/AMINE          M/E            RI/GHT            TYPE_P/RIOR

10/24/88  LPH
    Fixed bug that causes a Missing Page Fault when looking at large
    symbiont files.  See star 37020 for details.
08/05/87  LPH
    Fixed bug that prevented EXAMINing files > 1023 granules!
07/15/87  LPH
    Added the DVBYTE, NDVBYTE, FID, NFID options.  Also fixed bug, described in
    STARs 32684 and 33369, that caused BASS to stomp on things (in memory) when
    examining files greater than 2230 granules!
08/30/86  LPH
    Fixed bug (star #28672) introduced by the "go fast" option that would
    sometimes deny access to output produced by a running or ghost job.
04/20/86  LPH
    Added the "go fast" option.  If a specific sysid or job name is entered
    on an EXamine command, the file gets opened in seconds as opposed to the
    minutes, hours or days that it used to take!

DEBUG
Description:
     Indicates the user wants to see files containing nothing but a BANNER.
00001
{ D/ISPJOB | FMR/EAD | FMS/EC }
Description:
     Indicates that when the user does a subsequent LIST command, the user
     wants to search the entire queue and not only their own items.  If either
     of these PRIVileges are turned ON when BASS is invoked, this command will
     be simulated when BASS is invoked.  See the ME command to reverse this
     commands effects.
00001
[DI/SPLAY] DV/BYTE
Description:
     The DVBYTE command causes the DVBYTE information to be printed when
     the TO (Type Octal) command is issued.  The DVBYTE information indicates
     whether the record has BINary and/or TRANSparent information.  The length
     of the record, in bytes, is also printed.
 
     The DVBYTE command is the default but may be reversed via the NO DVBYTE
     command.
00001
{ EN/D | X/IT | Q/UIT }
Description:
     Exits BASS unless specified inside a READ file in which case the READ file
     is exited and M$SI is read.
00001
EX/AMINE what
Description:
     Identifies the item to be examined.  "what" must identify ONE and only ONE
     item.  If it does not, BASS will tell you how many items were found and
     ask you to try again.  If "what" is omitted and the previous LIST command
     only found ONE item, then that item will be EXamined.  For a description
     of "what" type 'Help WHAT' if you are currently in BASS or 'Help (BASS)
     WHAT' if you are not.
00001
[DI/SPLAY] FI/DS
     When specified, this option causes the symbiont file name to be displayed
     when subsequent EXAMINE or STATUS commands are issued.  The effects of
     this command may be reversed by the NOFIDS option.  The default is NOFIDS.
00001
F/IND [rec1] [-] [rec2] [,] /string/ [,[column1[,column2]]]
Description:
     The FIND command searches records "rec1" through "rec2" for an occurrance
     of "string" in columns "column1" through "column2".  If found, the record
     is typed out using the last form of the type command (TY,TS,TC,TO) used.
     If no form of the type command has been used since the current file was
     opened (EXAMINED) then the default is a TC (Type Compressed).  By default,
     the comparisons are case sensitive, meaning "string" must occur in the
     record EXACTLY as specified before the record is selected.  The compare
     may be made case insensitive by issuing the UC command.

FIND
H/ELP [(processor)] [ TOPICS ][ keyword1 ][ - ][ keyword2 ]
Parameters:
 processor is the processor or program for which HELP is being requested.  If
           not specified, BASS is assumed.
 TOPICS    requests a list of available HELP TOPICS for the current processor.
           The range of TOPICS is determined by "keyword1" and "keyword2".
 keyword1  specifies the name of the topic or message to be printed.
 keyword2  if a range is specified (by including a dash), keyword2 is the upper
           limit of the range.  If a range is not specified, "keyword2" is a
           submessage, or category within a message.
Description:
     Requests either a brief description of BASS (or "processor" if specified)
     or information about the specified command.
Examples:
     Help HELP
          Requests this HELP about the HELP command.
 Help (PCL) LIST
          Requests HELP on the PCL LIST command.

00001
BASS must reside in and be run from the :SYS account.  It is LINKed with
FMREAD (so it can see .:SYMO) and FMDIAG (so it can do block reads).
I/NTERPRET [S/PECIAL] [R/ECORDS]
     This command will cause BASS to "interpret" certain records within a
     symbiont file.  To be specific, those records containing "platen"
     information (first byte of record is '033'O) and records containing "tab"
     information (first byte of record is '021'O).  The effects of this command
     may be reversed via the NO INTERPRET command.  The default is
     INTERPRET.
LE/FT = value
Description:
     Indicates the column number of the first column that will be typed with
     any of the type commands (TY,TS,TO or TC) if columns are not specified on
     the type command.  LEFT is set to one when the EXAMINE command is issued.
00001
L/IST [what] { [not] [device] [@wsn] | -num | F/ORM [not] = form }
Parameters:
  device  specifies the possibly wildcarded device (LP,JE,etc.) that requested
          item(s) are destined for.
  wsn     specifies the possibly wildcarded wsn that the requested item(s) are
          destined for.
  form    specifies the possibly wildcarded form name that the requested
          item(s) must be using.
  not     has the form 'NOT', '~' or '<>' and negates the clause it precedes.
Description:
     The LIST command lists the sysid-num, number of granules, number of
     records, number of pages, destination device and wsn, jobname and account
     for any items found that meet the specified criteria.  For additional
     limiting criteria, see the SYSTEM and ME commands.

N/O B/ANNER
Description:
     Indicates the user does NOT wish to see the BANNER in the file(s)
     EXAMINEd.  Thus, all record numbers specified are relative to the end of
     the BANNER rather than the beginning of the file.  This is the default
     when a file is initially EXAMINEd but may be altered by the BANNER
     command.
00001
N/O DV/BYTE
     Reverses the effects of the DVBYTE command.

NUC
Description:
     Indicates NOT to translate lowercase to uppercase prior to comparisons (in
     the FIND command).  This is the default set when a file is EXAMINEd but
     may be reversed by the UC command.
00001
NO_VFC
OU/TPUT [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO}] fid
Description:
     Directs BASS's subsequent primary output to 'fid'.  If ON, TO, OVER and
     INTO are omitted, INTO is assumed.
00001
Lee Hallin, NSS / CP-6, LADC
{ RE/AD | XE/Q } fid
Description:
     Directs BASS to start reading commands from 'fid'.  When either an END or
     end-of-file is hit, BASS goes back to reading the original command stream
     (i.e.  what was being read before the READ command was issued).  Please
     note that READ commands may NOT be nested.
00001
RI/GHT = value
Description:
     Indicates the column number of the last column that will be typed with any
     of the type commands (TY,TS,TC or TO) if columns are not specified on the
     type command.  If RIGHT is not specified, the default is the last byte of
     each record.
