    LOOK is kind of a cross between PCL and EDIT.  It can be used to
LOOK at CONSEC,KEYED,RANDOM,UR,RELATIVE,INDEXED or IDS files (either
on DISK or TAPE).  It allows the user to get any or all of the following
for one record or a range of records:
  Number of records
  Byte counts
  EDIT keys
  Record KEYs (in octal and/or text)
  Record content, all or a portion, displayed in text
  Record content, all or a portion, displayed in octal, with or without ASCII
    interpreting.
  Record content for keys or records containing specified text or octal value.
    !LOOK source-file[,command-file] [TO ,output]
where:
    source-file   is file to LOOK at
    command-file  is file containing LOOK commands
    output        is FID that LOOKs output will go to
The following is a list of LOOK options.  Note that each option is
ONE character long.  LOOK does NOT use X$PARSE (yet) so it has some
dumb restrictions (ex: options must be uppercase) which will be lifted
in the next version.
 
N                            Gives Number of records in the file
 
B [f[-[l]]]                  Gives Byte counts of records f through l
 
E [f[-[l]]]                  Gives Edit keys (if it's an EDIT file) of
                                records f through l
 
K [f[-[l]]]                  Gives record Keys (if file is KEYED or
                                INDEXED) of records f through l
 
D [f[-[l]]] [:[b[-[e]]]]     Displays, in ASCII with UR translation,
                                bytes b through e of records f through l
 
I [f[-[l]]] [:[b[-[e]]]]     dumps, in octal with ASCII Interpreting,
                                bytes b through e of records f through l
 
O [f[-[l]]] [:[b[-[e]]]]     dumps, in octal, bytes b through e of records
                                f through l
 
F [f[-[l]]] /string/ [,[y[-[z]]]] [.[E] [D] [B] [I] [K] [O] [X] [b[-[e]]] ]
            'octal '         searches bytes y through z of records f
                                through l for an occurance of either
                                /string/ or 'octal'.  If found, the options
                                following the period will be performed.
 
S [f[-[l]]] /string/ [,[y[-[z]]]] [.[E] [D] [B] [I] [K] [O] [X] [b[-[e]]] ]
            'octal '         searches bytes y through z of the keys of
                             records f through l for an occurance of either
                             /string/ or 'octal'.  If found, the options
                             following the period will be performed.
 
  where:
    b   indicates Beginning column to be displayed (default is 1)
    e   indicates Ending column to be displayed (default is EOR)
    f   indicates First record to be considered (default is 1)
    l   indicates Last record to be considered (default is EOF)
    y   indicates beginning column to start search at (default is 1)
    z   indicates column to stop search at (default is 99999)
Examples:
 
    B                        Will give byte counts of all records
    B-5                      Will give byte counts of records 1 (default)
                             through 5
    B 5-                     Will give byte counts of records 5 though
                             the end of the file
    B 11-20                  Will give byte count of records 11 through
                             20
 
    E                        above examples for B apply to E

    F,'777',1,4.KI 4-9       Will search all records for an octal value
                             of '777' in bytes 1 through 4.  When found,
                             the key and bytes 4 through 9 will be displayed
                             in octal with ASCII interpreting to the right.
