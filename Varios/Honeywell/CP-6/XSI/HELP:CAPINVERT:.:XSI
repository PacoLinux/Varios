CAPINVERT inverts the bit-maps in a bitmapped (not byte-mapped) CAPPIX file.
Full command line syntax:
 
!CAPINVERT.X cappixfile OVER newcappixfile
 
Why would you want to do this?  Because you want to invert your picture, of
course.  But you might also want to change a DataCopy scanner picture into
vectors, which you can accomplish by:
 
1) uploading the DataCopy scanner file
 
2) using CAP to convert it to a CAPPIX file
 
3) Using CAPINVERT.X to invert it
 
4) Use the following command:
 
!VA$CR_LZ_AUX1 cappix TO vector(DEVICE=MD,H=#lines)
 
where "vector" is a file containing vector graphics, and #lines is the number
of scanlines to use for performing the conversion.
