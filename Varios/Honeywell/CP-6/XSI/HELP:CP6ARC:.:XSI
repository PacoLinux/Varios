CP6ARC.X will group files together into one "packed" file.
Command line syntax:
 
     !CP6ARC.X fid1 ON/TO/OVER fid2[(STD[,C/OMPRESS[)]]]
 
where:
 
fid1 - the wildcarded input, or a file which contains a list of files to
packup.
 
fid2 - the output or "packed" file.
 
STD - this option MUST be present if fid1 is a file containing a list of files
to pack up.
 
C/OMPRESS - this option will cause the files being packed to be compressed
during the packing process.
 
 
Before the first line of each file gets packed, the filename and the fit will
be packed.  This will allow CP6DEARC.X to later unpack the files back into
their original forms. If the file being packed is a keyed file, then the keys
will get packed prior to each line of record.
 
CP6ARC packs files which can be used as input to the tool CP6DEARC.X.  For more
information type HELP (CP6DEARC.X).
 
If the option STD is present, it means that fid1 is a file containing the list
of files to pack up.
 
Example:
 
!CP6ARC.X CHAP?.X OVER BOOK.X(C)
 
This command will take all files that begins with CHAP out of the X account and
pack them together into a file named BOOK.X in a compressed form.
 
!CP6ARC.X FILE_WITH_FILES TO PACKED_FILE(STD)
 
This command will take the list of filenames in FILE_WITH_FILES and pack them
together into a file named PACKED_FILE.
