XELA is a tool which will create an EDITable and/or PRINTable file from
a DRIBBLE file of a remote session like ALEX, RING, X28, or TELNET.
Full command line syntax: !XELA.X <dribblefile> OVER <outfile>
 
where: <dribblefile> is the remote session DRIBBLE file, and
       <outfile> is the EDITable and/or PRINTable file
 
DCBS: The DCBs used are M$SI and M$OU and may be !SET as you please;
XELA uses M$SI for <dribblefile> and M$OU for <outfile>.
 
One more thing...
 
Since this is a quick and not-so-comprehensive solution to the problem,
you should NOT specify a PROFILE once you have been logged on the the
target system; the PROFILE for :SYSTAC,LADC accounts (TI743) does not do
any cursor positioning and so will not send any characters to the
DRIBBLE file that XELA will throw away (thereby making your output file
unreadable).
Hmm...no more HELP for XELA.X is available.  Try the topics.
