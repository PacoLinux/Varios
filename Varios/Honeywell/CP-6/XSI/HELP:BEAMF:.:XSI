BEAMF.X is used to transport CP-6 files between CP-6 machines using a mechanism
other than HASP lines, most often microcomputer floppy disks.
 
Command syntax:
 
    !BEAMF.X input_fid [TO|OVER|INTO|ON] output_fid
 
 'input_fid' is the file you wish to move to another CP-6 site.
 'output_fid' is created by BEAMF, which will be the 'input file' encoded
     as 80-byte records containing only printable text.  File attributes and
     record keys from CP-6 will be maintained.
 
Example:
 
   Suppose we wish to ship a file, FSE, to another CP-6 site on a floppy disk.
The following steps would accomplish this.
 
1) Process the file using BEAMF
 
      !BEAMF.X FSE TO FSE_BEM
 
2) Download the output file, FSE_BEM, to a micro computer using
   KERMIT or MODEM.
 
3) Send the floppy disk containing FSE_BEM to the other CP-6 site.
 
4) Upload FSE_BEM to CP-6 from a micro.
 
5) !XEQ FSE_BEM.  This should result in the creation of the original
   file FSE.  Since the output from BEAMF does not have a RES card, the
   file cannot be batched.
 
Network Mail:
 
Files can also be shipped this way through network mail.  One problem here is
that invariably, a lot of trash will have been tacked onto the file along the
way (ie. mail headers).  The solution is to
 
   1) delete all lines in the file before the line beginning with
         !MAEB.X
 
   2) delete all lines in the file after the line
         !END
 
   3) !XEQ the file to restore the original file.
 
Another problem is that some mail servers will throw away or translate specific
printable characters.  Square brackets are particularily prone to this
treatment.  If this happens, the file will be unusable and MAEB.X will most
likely abort when you attempt to recreate the original file.
