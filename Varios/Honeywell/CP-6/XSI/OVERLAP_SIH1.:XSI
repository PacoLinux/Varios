.*B*
where:
 fpl-source (DCB=FPL)  - is the fid containing the FPL program
 cmd-file   (DCB=M$SI) - fid (default is ME) containing OVERLAP commands
 listing    (DCB=M$LO) - is OVERLAP's primary output
 cmds                  - one or more OVERLAP commands separated by semi-colons
                         If nothing follows the '(', the default is a
                         'Print IF' command.
.*B*
Once OVERLAP has read an FPL program, it can do the following:
  1) Detect and report on overlapping fields (i.e., two or more fields within
     one form which occupy the same column(s))
  2) Print all or a portion of all forms or specified forms and/or FRames
  3) Obtain a list of all FRames within each of the program's forms
.*B*
Note:  In this version of OVERLAP, some forms of two dimensional REPEATs
       are not handled correctly.

.*K* ABSTRACT
OVERLAP can be quite useful when you are at the point of designing your
forms and want to see what the form will look like before you actually
start coding the procedure.  OVERLAP needs the following minimum FPL program
in order to work correctly:
  1) a 'PROGRAM-ID. program-id.' line
  2) at least one 'FD xxx FRAMES ARE ...' line
  3) a 'FRAME SECTION' line
  4) at least 1 'FR frame' line followed by a frame description
  5) a 'PROCEDURE DIVISION.' line
With these minimal requirements you can design your form before you start
coding your procedure.
.*K* ADJACENT
A/DJACENT [F/IELDS] [ARE] [O/K]
    Tells OVERLAP not to detect adjacent fields without at least one blank
    between them.  This command is used when the FPL program is going
    to execute on at terminal which does not REQUIRE at least one blank
    between fields.
.*K* CHECK
C/HECK [[form-or-frame,...] [L/INES {n1|n1-n2},...]]
    Tells OVERLAP to check the indicated lines within the indicated
    form(s) and/or FRame(s) for overlapping fields.  If no forms/frames and
    no lines are specified, all forms are selected and lines 1 through
    the highest line in any form are used.
.*K* END
E/ND
    Exits OVERLAP.
.*K* EXAMPLES
The simplest use of OVERLAP is something like the following:
 !OVERLAP.X fpl-source(
Which does an implied 'PRINT IF' which looks at all the forms in 'fpl-source'
and prints out any lines containing errors.  Note that the '(' IS required.
 
.*K* HELP
H/ELP [command]
    Gives the user help on OVERLAP in general, or the syntax of the
    specified 'command'.
.*K* LIST
L/IST
    Lists the name of each form within the FPL source file followed by
    all its FRames.
.*K* NOADJACENT NO_ADJACENT
N/O AD/JACENT [F/IELDS] [ARE] [O/K]
    Reverses the effect of the Adjacent command.
.*K* OUTPUT
O/UTPUT [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO}] fid
    Directs OVERLAP's subsequent primary output to 'fid'.  If ON,TO,OVER and
    INTO are omitted, INTO is assumed.
.*K* PRINT
P/RINT [[form-or-frame,...] [L/INES {n1|n1-n2},...]]
    Prints the specified lines of the specified form(s)/FRame(s).  If
    all options are omitted, lines 1 through the highest line in any form
    are printed for each form described within the source program.
.*K* PRINTCHECK PRINT_CHECK
P/RINT CH/ECK [[form-or-frame,...] [L/INES {n1|n1-n2},...]]
    Prints the specified lines of the specified form(s)/FRame(s).  If all
    options are omitted, lines 1 through the highest line in any form are
    printed for each form described within the source program.  If any
    errors are detected, the PRINT is followed by an implicit CHECK command.
.*K* PRINTIF PRINT_IF
P/RINT IF [[form-or-frame,...] [L/INES {n1|n1-n2},...]]
    Prints only the lines in the specified form(s)/FRame(s) which had
    overlapping and/or adjacent field errors.
.*K* QUIT
Q/UIT
    Exits OVERLAP.
.*K* READ
R/EAD fid
    Reads OVERLAP commands from 'fid'.  Unless 'fid' contains an 'END'
    command, the user will be prompted for additional commands once
    end-of-file is hit on 'fid'.
.*K* USE
U/SE fid
    Tells OVERLAP to use 'fid' as the fpl-source program.
.*K* XIT
X/IT
    Exits OVERLAP.
.*K* XINDEX
OVERLAP.X
.*R*
AID=PROGRAMMING
.*R*
TP_AIDS
.*R*
.*K* XINDEX_ABSTRACT
TOOL=OVERLAP
.*R*
Reads a FPL source program and then can be directed to check for
overlapping fields and/or to print one or more forms described in the program.
