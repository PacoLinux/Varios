    EVERY.X is a program which allows the user to specify one or
more processor, program, or IBEX commands to be executed several times.
 
    !EVERY.X [(] [IA] [ST] [t*] [s] !xxx... [!xxx... ...]
      where:
    IA tells EVERY to Ignore Altreturns on M$LINK/M$YCs.
    ST tells EVERY to Suppress the Time,date,ETMF line on each interation.
    t  is the number of times to execute the specified commands.
       Default is 604800 (One week if s=10).
    s  is the interval, in seconds, at which to repeat the commands.
       Default is 10.
 
NOTES:
    1)  If the first and last bytes of the command line are non-blank and the
        ST option was not specified then a blank line followed by a line
        of the form:
          HH:MM:SS.SS  MM/DD/YY  nu*etmf<nprt
        is output prior to each iteration.
        (Where: nu=current number of users, etmf=current ETMF and
                nprt=current 90% response time)
    2)  Hitting BREAK will cause EVERY to prompt with "C to continue:",
        allowing a clean exit when invoked from inside another program.
Examples:
    !EVERY.X 60!SPY A=youracct
      Will do a '!SPY A=youracct' command every 60 seconds, 604800 times
      (604800 being the default iteration value).
 
      This is handy to see how much time your job(s) is/are getting.
      It saves you the trouble of repeatedly ESC Ding when you're
      impatiently SPYing on your job!
 
    !EVERY.X (!DI
      Will do a '!DI' command every 10 seconds, 604800 times
      (10 & 604800 being defaults).  This totals one week!
 
    !EVERY.X 15!ST !DI!SPY(B
      Will do a '!ST', '!DI' and '!SPY(B' command every 15 seconds, 604800
      times.
 
    !EVERY.X 15*60!SPY 1234
      Will do a '!SPY 1234' every 60 seconds, 15 times.
 
    ! EVERY.X 15*60!SPY 1234
      Same as above except the time, etc. won't be output prior to each
      iteration (Note the blank following the !).
 
    !EVERY.X IA !L file
      Will do a 'L file' command every 10 seconds and will not stop (because
      of the IA option) if "file" does not exist.  This is handy when you're
      impatiently waiting for a file to get create someplace!
