ENCRYPT  - tool to encrypt source files with a 72-bit (8-character) key.
.*B*
 
ENCRYPT is a block mode encryption program that encrypts plain text in
72-bit blocks, using a 72-bit key. The algorithm used for encryption is
vaugely similar to the DES algorithm.
 
.*B*
How to use:
 
  !ENCRYPT.X source-file (ON|OVER|TO) destination
  *encryption seed
 
Examples:
 
  !ENCRYPT.X SALES-REPORT OVER SALES_REPORT
  *HELLO DOLLY    "notice only first 8 characters of key are used
 
  !ENCRYPT.X SALES-REPORT OVER SALES_REPORT
  *36-24-26       "this file now doubly encrypted
 
.*B*
To then decrypt your file, you should use DECRYPT.X.
