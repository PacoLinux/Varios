03/20/88  TJC
Made the UTS output match for RU's, OU's, and FEP RU's.
04/27/88
Convinced SL.X that PROOF_DIC.X (or any file containing a record with a key of
HEAD) was not a Run Unit!
08/26/86  LPH  #30513
Corrected problem where all run unit starting addresses were displayed in hex
after a FEP run unit had been displayed.
01/12/86  LPH  #27229
Fixed SL so it doesn't loop if a packset is not up as per STAR #27229.
06/23/85  LPH
Taught SL about FEP Run Units ($SA is displayed in hex and size is calculated
based on FEP page size).
03/06/85  DGH
Displays the full UTS when working on OU's.
09/27/84  CES
Changed so that only one file is opened when fid is not wildcarded.
09/19/84  CKW
Fixed compiler names to reflect B$OBJECT_C EQUs
08/09/84  CES
Added true wildcarding
05/09/84  JLJ
Fixed to look at files on private packs.  You're welcome, Ted.
03/15/84  CKW
Fixed so knows about L6ASM and ELSIE OUs
