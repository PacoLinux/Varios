              CP6 LNCOUNT  A00 JAN 1981
 
         LNCOUNT is a program tool used to count the number of
comment lines and source lines from files in controlled accounts and
report this information to a unit-record file or terminal.
The Data Base file is saved for comparisons.
All commands and keywords may be abbreviated to the least ambiguous
number of characters except where noted.

_____________________________________________________________
 
DATA name[.acct]                   (a CP6 fid but file name Max. is 27 chars)
   Opens data base file name$$LNC.  If the file does not already
   exist, it will be created when first Counted into.
 
SOURCE acct,tag            (acct is any legal CP-6 account)
                           (tag is 1 to 4 characters, normally version)
   Opens the files from the account specified,
counting the number of source lines and comment lines in the file of
that account and enters the count in the Data Base.
 
UPDATE acct,acct,tag       (acct is any legal CP-6 account)
                           (tag is 1 to 4 characters, normally version)
   Acts just like SOURCE except the second account
given will be treated as the update account (first account is for the
Source file account). Lines will be counted from the update files and a
merge of both the source and update file is done.
 
NOTE: The tags given on the SOURCE and UPDATE commands will be saved
      in the Data Base and will be used for reporting purposes.
Also, a list file (either by the !SET F$LIST or the LIST command) is
      required before SOURCE or UPDATE counting can proceed.
 
SREPORT [stat fid],tag,tag    (if fid not specified then default is 'ME')
                              (stat is either 'ON','INTO', or 'OVER')
                              (tag is 1 to 4 characters)
      Creates a report of the counting results
from the Data Base which is currently open. The comparison will be
between two 'Source' counts. The reported data will contain:
Source totals form both, Comment Totals from both, and the numerical
differance of the two.
 
UREPORT [stat fid],tag,tag    (if fid not specified then default is 'ME')
                              (stat is either 'ON','INTO', or 'OVER')
                              (tag is 1 to 4 characters)
      Creates a report of the counting results
from the Data Base which is currently open. The comparison will be
between a 'Source' count and an 'Update' count. The report will contain:
Source totals from both, Comment Totals from both, Percentage of the
UPDATE/SOURCE, and the Merged totals.
 
LIST fid
    Specifies the List file (fumble type) to be used
to specify what files of the accounts are to be counted. The file name,
Language, Processor, and Owner are obtained from this file also.
 
Each record should be in the following format:
file-name,JCL:language,processor,{other fumble commands...}   owner
 
TITLE =string                   (string terminates with end of line)
    Appends the 'string' given to the sting
    'Line Count Report For '. If a TITLE command has not been given
    before an OUTPUT command is, the default Title will be
    'Line Count Report'. In both cases, the Title is centered and the
    largest string may consist of 77 characters.
 
 
To exit LNCOUNT any of the following will do:
 
   END , Q[uit], X
