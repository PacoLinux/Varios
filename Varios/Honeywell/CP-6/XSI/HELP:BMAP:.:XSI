USAGE:
 
!BMAP.:SYS source[,update] [{ON|OVER|INTO} [object][,listing]] [(options)]
 
The following DCBs are used:
 
         source    M$SI
         update    M$UI
         object    M$OU
         listing   M$LO
 
Options:
 
         1P        1-pass assembly (default is 2 pass)
         2P        2-pass assembly (default is 2 pass)
         LU        List the update file
         LS        Produce source listing, including octal, on M$LO. (default
                   if listing file specified)
         NLS       No listing
         OU        Produce object output on M$OU. (default if object file
                   specified)
         NOU       No object output
         SC[HEMA]  Include debug schema in object output. (default)
         NSC[HEMA] No debug schema
         SO        Produce (updated) source output on M$SO.
         SR[CH](fid,fid,...) Specify accounts to be searched for LODM files.
                   These accounts are searched in order, then the current
                   account, then :SYS.
         UI        Read update input from M$UI. (default if update file
                   specified)
         NUI       No update input
         XR[EF]    Produce symbol and macro cross-reference listings on M$LO.
 
         If no options are specified, 2P, LS and OU are assumed.
 
FEATURES:
 
BMAP accepts GMAP language with the following exceptions:
 
The location field must begin in column 1.
The operation field must start within 15 columns of the location field.
The variable field must start within 15 columns of the operation field.
If the first 16 columns of an input line are blank, the card will be treated as
a comment card.  Otherwise a blank operation field is treated as a NULL
pseudo-operation.
E/O/8 in column 7 is not recognized; use EVEN, ODD, or EIGHT.
 
The following pseudo-operations are not implemented:
 
       ABS     BEGIN   CALL    DCARD   ERLK    FEQU    FUL     HEAD
       LOC     LODST   MASK    MAX     MIN     OLDALT  PRGST   PUNCH
       PUNM    PUNST   RETURN  SAVE    TCD     TOC
 
The following pseudo-operations are ignored:
 
       CPR     CPRU    DELM    EDITP   LBL     MAXSZ
 
The defaults for the following ON/OFF pseudo-operations are:
 
       CRSM    OFF
       DETAIL  ON
       HEXFP   ON
       LIST    ON
       PCC     ON
       PMC     OFF
       REF     ON
       REFMA   ON
 
The following pseudo-operations are implemented differently in BMAP:
 
       BLOCK,USE The variable field contains an optional second subfield,
               namely, an expression to specify the section type according to
               the table on p. 10 of AF#0073C-0 (section 8.6).  The default
               section types are:
 
                   BLOCK   4 (non-root labeled COMMON)
                   USE     1 (procedure)
 
       DEC,OCT In each subfield, if the first nondelimiter is a letter, the
               subfield is evaluated as an expression.  Otherwise, it is
               evaluated as a decimal or octal number.
 
       LIT     The literals declared up to this point are generated.  A symbol
               in the location field, if any, is defined to be the first
               location of the current literal control section.  Then a new
               literal control section is allocated.  The names of all of the
               literal control sections are the same, namely, 'LITERALS'.
 
       TTLS    TTL and TTLS are identical.  There is one heading
               line which contains the title specified on the
               most recent TTL or TTLS.
 
       VEC,VECB,FVEC,FVECB,SVEC,SVECB  The generated size field is
               1 byte less than the size parameter.
 
The following GCOS macros are implemented as pseudo-operations:
 
       DDSC    wsr,base,size,flags (flags=R,W,S,B,X,E,P,N,M,ALL)
       DDSCW   wsn,base,size,flags
       DLDSC
       EDSCnn  wsr,base,size,isegno,entry,S (nn=16, 24, OR 64; size in
                                             descriptors)
       IDSC    wsr,loc
       ODSB    wsr,base,size,flags (base,size in bytes)
       ODSBW   wsn,base,size,flags (base,size in bytes)
       ODSC    wsr,base,size,flags
       ODSCW   wsn,base,size,flags
 
These macros generate a bound field that is 1 byte less
than the specified size parameter.
 
The following additional pseudo-operations are available:
 
       ENTDEF  declares procedure entry points.
 
       ENTREF  defines external procedure references.
 
       HEXFP   Controls the generation of floating point numbers:
                   ON (default) Generate hexadecimal floating point numbers.
                   OFF Generate binary floating point numbers.
 
       PAGE    forces page boundary alignment (like EIGHT).
 
       SEGREF  defines external segment references.
 
Literals may be used for constants in expressions, in instruction address
fields with index modification, and in non-address fields.
 
Default section name = blank, type = procedure.
Literal section name = 'LITERALS', type = read-only data.
 
All symbols other than operations and macro names must be unique.
Symbols may include the characters . $ @ _
Symbols may be up to 30 characters long; more will be ignored.
At least one character must not be a digit.

***** WARNING: Do not ORG backwards then assemble code.  This may cause BMAP
*****          not to generate an object unit.
 
*******************************************************************************
 
Version B06 available April 5, 1979.
 
Correction:
 
       If I/O errors occur, standard system error messages are displayed
       through M$DO.
 
New features:
 
       The Step Condition Code is now set to indicate assembly or
       I/O errors:
 
           Severity    STEPCC
               0          0     No errors.
               4          1     Assembly errors or list file errors.

              15          4     Object file errors (no object generated).
 
       Pressing BREAK causes the current pass and line number to be displayed
       through M$DO.
 
*******************************************************************************
 
Version B07 available June 14, 1979.
 
Corrections:
 
       =M and =V literals now assemble properly.
 
       The format of input lines has been changed to be more compatible with
       GMAP. (See above)
 
       The parameter scan on macro calls and IDRPs now processes parentheses
       and brackets correctly.
 
       A bug in the IDRP processing which caused BMAP to loop has been fixed.
 
       The ENTDEF or SYMDEF of a symbol may now follow the symbol.
 
       Strange sequences of EQUs, definitions, and references will now
       assemble correctly.  If they don't, try the 2P option.
 
       The macro expansion buffer has been increased to 256 characters.
 
New features:
 
       Floating point numbers may now be assembled.  The HEXFP pseudo-operation
       (see above) controls whether binary or hexadecimal floating point values
       are generated.
 
       The EDEC pseudo-operation is now implemented.
 
       A number of GMAP pseudo-ops which were previously not implemented are
       now ignored.
 
*******************************************************************************
 
Version 08 available August 22, 1979.
 
Corrections:
 
       The input card scanner has reverted to version B06.
 
       The DEC and OCT pseudo-operations will now accept both numeric values,
       such as floating-point, and expressions. (See above.)
 
       If there is no ENTDEF, one will be created with the object unit name.
 
       The BLOCK pseudo-operation now more closely resembles that of GMAP,
       in that the section name and type are now both in the variable field.
 
       The TTL and TTLS pseudo-operations now start the variable field in
       column 16 or the first non-blank after the operation field, whichever
       comes first.
 
       The VFD pseudo-operation now accepts fields > 36 bits in any position.
 
       When BREAK is struck, the pass and line number are now output through
       M$ME, instead of M$DO.
 
       Errors in the scanning of macro calls ending in commas which were not
       continued are now corrected.
 
New features:
 
       The DATE, PCC, REF, REFMA, TTLDAT, CRSM, and ORGCSM pseudo-operations
       are now implemented.
 
       Created symbols (see GMAP manual, DD08, p. 6-55) are now implemented.
       Their format is _nnnn_, where nnnn is a decimal number starting at 0000.
 
       The title line format has been changed to resemble that of PL6.
       The account name is suppressed if it matches the current account name.
       If space is available, the update file name.account is included in the
       title line.
 
       The symbol cross-reference listing now indicates (with a *) the line(s)
       where the symbol is defined.
 
       The REF bit of the object unit variable debug record entries is now set
       if the symbol is referenced.
 
       The circumflex ('^') is no longer used as an end-of-line delimiter.
 
*****************************************************************************
 
Version 09 available September 7, 1979.
 
Corrections:
 
       Within macro calls with PMC OFF, don't print line with only location
       value.
 
       DETAIL OFF suppresses printing of forward reference resolutions
       and literals.
 
       PCC OFF now does not suppress printing of (some) comments.
 
       If a macro contains LIST OFF as the first line, PMC OFF now does not
       suppress printing of the macro call line.
 
New features:
 
       Within macro calls with PMC OFF, the octal for EQUs is printed.
 
       PCC OFF suppresses the printing of lines skipped by IFE, INE, IFG, IFL.
 
       The FLOAT, BFS, and LIT pseudo-operations are now implemented.
       (See above.)
 
       The END pseudo-operation prints the start address, if any.
 
*****************************************************************************
 
Version 10 available January 1985.
 
New features:
 
       The following S-1000 instructions have been added:
          DFLP, DFSBI, FLP, FRAN, FSBI, FTR, LCCL, LIMR, LLUF,
          QFAD, QFLD, QFMP, QFSB, QFST, QFSTR, QSMP, RCCL, RIMR,
          RPN, SFR, TRCT, UFTR, and XRAN.
 
       In addition, the vector instructions have been added:
          VDFAD, VDFDV, VDFIG, VDFIN, VDFIP, VDFIT, VDFMA, VDFMN,
          VDFMP, VDFMS, VDFMX, VDFNG, VDFSB, VDFSM, VDFSN, VDFTN,
          VDFVN, VDFVP, VDFXG, VFAD, VFDV, VFIP, VFIPN, VFIT,
          VFITN, VFMA, VFMAX, VFMDS, VFMIG, VFMIN, VFMP, VFMS,
          VFMSD, VFMVN, VFMVP, VFMXG, VFNG, VFSB, VFSM, VFSN,
          VIAD, VIIP, VIIPN, VIIT, VIITN, VIMA, VIMAX, VIMIG,
          VIMIN, VIMP, VIMS, VIMVN, VIMVP, VIMXG, VING, VISB,
          VISM, VISN, VLAN, VLER, VLOR, VMVD, and VMVS.
 
       In coding uses of these vector instructions, one, two, or three
       MFn fields must be specified in the variable field, as appropriate
       for the instruction being used.  RL and ID should be zero, while
       REG must indicate an index register.
 
       Each use of these vector instructions must be immediately
       followed by one, two, or three vector descriptors as
       approprite to the particular instruction being used.  To
       facilitate construction of these descriptors, the following
       two new descriptor operations have been added:
 
          VDSC - Vector Descriptor with Explicit Separation
          VDSCX - Vector Descriptor with Separation in Index Register
 
       The format for use of these is:
 
          VDSC  LOCSYM,SEP[,[RN][,AM]]
          VDSCX LOCSYM,SEP[,[RN][,AM]]
       where:
          LOCSYM is as used in other descriptors such as ADESC
          SEP is the specification of the number of words separating
             elements of the vector; it is a decimal value for VDSC
             and an index register nomination for VDSCX.
          RN is the specification of the index register which
             contains the count of the number of vector elements
             which must be present in the first/only descriptor.
          AM is as used in other descriptors.
 
       Secondary reference pseudo-ops have also been added as
 
          SENTRF - Secondary ENTREF
          SSEGRF - Secondary SEGREF
          SSYMRF - Secondary SYMREF
 
       In response to star #15424, the following message has been added:
          2 PASS INPUT UNBALANCED
 
       Stars  3729 and 8771 are closed by this release.  For 8771, the
following DSC type operations have been added:
 
          ADSC4X, ADSC6X, ADSC9X, BDSCX, NDSC4X, & NDSC9X
 
       These force the length specification to be treated as a register
specification.
**********************************************************************
 
Version 11 available August 1987.
 
New features:
 
       The following RPM instructions have been added:
          LCON, RCW, RIW, RMID, RMR, RRES, SIW, SMID, SMR, SYNC.
 
       The optional UI flag is now set on the source in open.
