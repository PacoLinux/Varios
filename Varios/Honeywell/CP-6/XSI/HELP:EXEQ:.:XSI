EXEQ.X allows only a portion of an XEQ file to be XEQ/BATCHed with DEFAULT
commands retained no matter where they occur in the file.  The "portion" may be
selected by record number range(s), EDIT key range(s), IBEX label(s) and/or
whether the record contains a specified string.
Invocation syntax:
 !EXEQ.X xeq-file [(IBEX-options)] ["EXEQ.X-options"]
where:
 xeq-file        The file from which the desired record(s) will be extracted.
 IBEX-options    Any options that are legal on a stand-alone XEQ or BATCH
                 command
 EXEQ.X-options  Any of EXEQs options
 
For a list of available options, type '?' or 'HELP (EXEQ.X) TOPICS'
For a description of a specific option, type 'HELP (EXEQ.X) option'
For a description of all options, type 'HELP (EXEQ.X) A - Z'
In the list below, only characters before the slash(/) are required.

    Indicates you wish to BATCH the resultant file rather than XEQ it.

C/ONTAINS' '=' string
    Indicates that you wish to keep any records with "string" in them.

E/ND = { editkey | recordnumber | label }
    Indicates the STARTed range is to stop at the record meeting this selection
    criteria.  There may (but shouldn't) be multiple END options specified.  If
    there are, only the last one is retained.
To only XEQ the PL6 compile (line 12) for EXEQ.X, one might say the following:
  !EXEQ.X EXEQ_CRU.:XSI "12"
 
To do the PL6 compile through the PARTRGE of the EXEQ_SIN1 file, one could
try:
  !EXEQ.X EXEQ_CRU.:XSI "FROM=PL6,TO=SIN1"
 
To only do the LINK:
  !EXEQ.X EXEQ_CRU.:XSI "F=LINK"
 
To do the PL6 compile, both PARTRGEs and the LINK, one could type:
  !EXEQ.X EXEQ_CRU.:XSI "12-14,25-"
 
To build an XEQ/BATCH file (called YOURS) with records containing 'PL6' or
'PART' and the first record containing 'LINK' and all subsequent records, you
could try:
  !EXEQ.X EXEQ_CRU.:XSI "C=PL6,C=PART,FROM=LINK,SAVE OVER YOURS"
F/ROM = string
    Indicates to start selecting records when a record containing "string"
    is encountered.  There can (but shouldn't) be multiple FROM options
    specified in which case the last one specified will be retained.  Once a
    record with "string" is encountered, subsequent records will be kept until
    either the end of "xeq-file" is encountered or a record containing the
    "string" specified on a TO option is encountered.
NO_DEFAULTS
NO_GLOBALS
ND/EFAULT
    Indicates to skip IBEX DEFAULT commands.
NG/LOBALS
    Indicates to skip IBEX GLOBAL commands.

{ first [- [last]] | - last }
    Specifies which record(s) are to be selected.  "first" and "last" may be
    relative record positions within the "xeq-file" or EDIT keys.  There can
    be any number of ranges and the type of selection of "last" does not have
    to be the same used in "first" (i.e. "first" could specify relative record
    number while "last" could specify EDIT key; or visa versa).
Also see the CONTAINS, END, EXAMPLE, FROM, START and TO options.
SA/VE [{ON|INTO|OVER} fid]
    Indicates that instead of XEQing or BATCHing the file resulting from the
    selection criteria that a file is to be created.  If "fid" is not
    specified, then a file called "*EXEQnnnnn" (where nnnnn is the current
    job step number) is created.  If "fid" is specified, then a file of that
    name will be created (if possible).  In either case, EXEQ will output a
    message of the form "Results are in ???".
S/TART = { editkey | recordnumber | label }
    Indicates to start selecting records when a record with the specified
    editkey, recordnumber or IBEX label is encountered.  There may (but
    shouldn't) be multiple START options specified in which case the last one
    specified will be retained.  Once a record meeting the selection criteria
    specified on the START option is found, subsequent records will be retained
    until either the end of "xeq-file" is encountered or a record meeting the
    selection criteria specified on a END option is encountered.
T/O = string
    Indicates to stop retaining records (previously started via the FROM
    option) when a record containing "string" is encountered.
EXEQ.X

XEQ_FILES
TOOL=EXEQ
Allows a user to easily select a portion of an XEQ file to be XEQ/BATCHed with
!GLOBALs and !DEFAULTs retained no matter where they occur in the XEQ file.
