     RGT  READ  GCOS  TAPES
  THIS PROGRAM READS GCOS SOURCE TAPES AND
      SEPARATES THE SOURCE AND OBJECT MODULES
      INTO INDIVIDUAL FILES ON CP-6
 
 
BCD files are converted to ASCII
Compressed files are decomressed.
 
      THE INPUT TAPE IS READ THRU  M$SI
      THE OUTPUT FILES ARE THRU    M$OU
      ANY COMMENTARY IS THRU       M$LO
 
THERE ARE FOUR OPTIONS AVAILABLE ON THE COMMAND LINE
1) APPEND    ALLOWS FOR THE SPLITTING OF COBOL INCLUDE
             FILES INTO CP-6 FILES OF THE APPEND NAME.
             THE DATA IS EXPECTED TO BE BRACKETED BY
             APPEND <INCLUDE NAME>  STARTING IN COL 1
             AND BY *END*  STARTING IN COL 1.
2) NOCOM     PREVENTS RGT FROM COMPRESSING OUT THE TRAILING BLANKS.
3) PARTIAL   RGT WILL INCLUDE THE LAST BLANK AFTER THE NONE BLANK DATA.
4) NOSPLIT   DO NOT SPLIT INPUT BY $ CARDS
 
EXAMPLE -
  !RGT.X FT#1234 (APPEND,NOCOM)
THIS EXAMPLE WILL SPLIT THE COBOL INCLUDE FILES (INPUT TO GCOS SRCLIB)
INTO INDIVIDUAL CP-6 FILES WITH THE SAME NAME AS ON THE APPEND
DIRECTIVE AND WITH NO COMPRESSION OF THE RECORDS.
