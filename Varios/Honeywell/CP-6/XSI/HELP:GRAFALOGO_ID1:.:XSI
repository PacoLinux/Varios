GRAFALOGO_ID1 contains vector graphics information used for the default LOGO

Full command line syntax:
 
None:  data file only
 
By the way, by default, this is a filled CP-6 logo.  However, this file (and
the supporting underlying mechanism in GRAFASLIDE) were intended to provide a
site with a way of making their own LOGO their site's default without munching
on GRAFASLIDE's internals.
