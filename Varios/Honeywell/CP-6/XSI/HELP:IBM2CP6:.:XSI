IBM2CP6.X converts IBM print files (with FORTRAN VFC) to CP-6 print files (with
CP-6 VFC).  Unlike PCL's FVFC option, this changes the VFC codes to be CP-6
"space after" codes, rather than using CP-6 "space before" codes.
To use:
 
!IBM2CP6.X input_file OVER output_file
 
It is assumed that every record in the input file has the "standard" FORTRAN
VFC character in column 1 (space, +, or 1), and that no record is more than 133
bytes long.  Violating either assumption will cause IBM2CP6 to exit
ungracefully.
 
The output file uses three standard CP-6 "space after" VFC codes:  (A,`, and
p).  Records are not written to the output file with VFC set.
 
Input is through M$SI, output is through M$OU.
