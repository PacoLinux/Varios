LIBTV will accept as input a Shared Library RU with a Transfer Vector
linked in.
 
LIBTV will move the ENTDEF's to the appropriate Transfer Vector locations
and add ENTDEF's for the entry points of the routines.  The new entry
points will be the same names with an underscore(_) appended unless
the name is already thirty characters, in which case no new name is added.
 
The RU to be modified is accessed through #1(M$SI).

LIBTV accepts the following options:
         [N]FO[RMAT] - Specifies whether transfer vector transformation
         is to take place. FORMAT is the default.
         ENTDEF's not in the transfer vector are removed.
         [N]LI[ST] - Specifies whether a listing of the transfer vector
         and a listing of ENTDEF's not in the transfer vector is to
         be produced on #4(M$LO). LIST is the default.
         [N]CO[MPARE] - Specifies whether the modified RU specified
         by M$SI is to be compared with the transfer vector
         in the RU specified by #2(M$UI). If it is to be compared,
         an exception report is given. NCOMPARE is the default.

The steps to follow to prepare a Shared Library RU with a transfer vector
are as follows:
 
1. Assemble a module made up as follows:
         ENTDEF    _TV_ST
_TV_ST   BSS       0
         ENTREF    def1
         TRA       def1
         .
         .
         .
         ENTREF    defn
         TRA       defn
         ENTDEF    _TV_EN
_TV_EN   BSS       1
         END
 
2. Link the transfer vector module with all modules to be included in the
library following it.
!LINK tvou,libou1,...liboun ON libru(SLIB)
 
3. Use LIBTV.
!LIBTV.X libru
