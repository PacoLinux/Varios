Lower-case letters are now treated the same as upper-case.  The substitution
character for a dot in column 1 is changed from ` to [ to avoid messing up
boxes around figures.  The original widow setting is restored at the end of the
drawn figures.  861014 JES
Fixed to allow any number of symbols in a macro, rather than fixed limit of
