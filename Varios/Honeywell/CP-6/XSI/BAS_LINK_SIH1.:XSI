BAS_LINK is a programme that performs some linker-like functions
for object units created by the ASMZ80.X and ASM6502.X packages.
micro-processor.
 
BAS_LINK is written in CP-6 BASIC.
.*B*
 
BAS_LINK does the following:
    o Read a file that contains ASMZ80/6502 schema.
    o Read a single OU that contains unsatisfied REFs.  Note that
      this RU can load non-contigious pieces of memory.
    o The user may create new schema records.
    o The run-unit (RU) is created in one chunk from the lowest
      piece of memory loaded to the highest.
    o Schema may be included in the RU or disgarded after the
      symbol resolution phase.
.*B*
 
Invocation syntax:
 
  !BASIC
  >CLOAD BAS_LINK.X
  >RUN
.*B*
 
NOTES:
 o Unlike a real linker, BAS_LINK does no relocation!  All it does
   is satisfy DEF/REFs and tweak schema.

  and its overlays.
