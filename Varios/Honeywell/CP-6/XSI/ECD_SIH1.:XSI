ECD is a subroutine (from CP-V) that converts an
SBIN WORD value to English text.  For example, 123 is converted
to "one hundred twenty-three".  The routine is callable by PL-6,
FORTRAN, COBOL, and GMAP and will produce cardinal results (e.g.,
2 -> "two") or ordinal results (e.g., 2-> "second").

Calling sequence:
 
    CALL ECD (source, dest [, flag])
 
source - is an SBIN WORD value (word-aligned) to be converted.
 
dest - is a character string to receive the result.  The result is
    returned in TEXTC format, with the first byte being the count
    of characters.  The maximum length of the string is 134*
    characters; however dest need not be that long if the user
    knows the magnitude of the source values.  (*-33777777777
    produces a string of 132 characters in ordinal mode, plus
    one for the TEXTC count, plus one for a "working" blank
    used by the subroutine but not counted in the TEXTC byte.)
 
flag - is an optional cardinal/ordinal flag.  If omitted or false,
    cardinal values are returned ("two").  If true, ordinal values
    are returned ("second").

Notes:
 
o   source is always treated as a signed value.
 
o   Negative values are returned preceded by the word "minus".
 
o   Results are always returned in lower case.
 
o   The surboutine always creates the string with a trailing
    blank character, which the user must allow for when sizing
    the dest field; however, this blank character is not counted
    in the TEXTC count.
