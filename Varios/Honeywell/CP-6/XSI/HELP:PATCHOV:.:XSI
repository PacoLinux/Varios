PATCHOV allows online access to currently installed monitor overlays.
Use PATCHOV as follows (SPCLMM and/or EXMM privilege is necessary):
 
!PATCHOV.X [options]
 
where "options" are any of (separated by commas):
 
OVERLAY=overlay-name  -  specifies the name of the overlay you wish to
access.  If this option is not used, PATCHOV will prompt for the name.
Specifying ? makes PATCHOV show you a list of the overlay names it can find
in M:MON.:SYS.
 
SHOWDEFS=1  -  causes PATCHOV to display the defs it found for the overlay,
and report any that were in excess of DELTA's limit.
 
RUACCT and PATCHOV can also be substituted if PATCHOV is installed
unusually.
 
PATCHOV will then XEQ some JCL to access M:MON.:SYS to determine the
overlay's number, build a list of its ENTDEFs in *NDEFS, and then invoke
PATCHOV again to map in that overlay and all of the root except the first
two pages (where PATCHOV lives), and then M$ALIB to DELTA with a "READ
*NDEFS" command to DEF all the primary ENTDEFs for that overlay.  DELTA is
then in what amounts to ANLZ mode.  For overlays with too many ENTDEFs,
some number of "Too many user defs" messages will then occur.  If you need
the ENTDEFs that didn't fit, you can KDEFs and DEF the ones you want.  Or,
you can edit *NDEFS and invoke the second phase directly (PATCHOV.X
*NDEFS).
