DIPRO.X displays the names of PROFILEs available on CP-6.  Unlike the IBEX
DI PROFILE command, DIPRO accepts wildcarded names as well as selection by
profile type (ASYNC,3270,URP,etc.).
Invocation syntax:
 
  !DIPRO.X [profile-name] [,profile-file] [{ON|OVER}, listing-file] [(options)]
 
profile-name  - name, possibly wildcarded, of the profiles to display
profile-file  - the name of the CP-6 file that contains the profiles
                to be searched.  If not specified, :PRO.:SYS will be searched.
 
options are:                                      Default:
 
     3/270                                        No
     AL/L                                         No

     A/TTRIBUTES                                  No
     E/XTENDED A/TTRIBUTES                        No
    {FI/RST | FR/OM} = first-name                 First available ASYNC profile
     LA/ST = last-name                            Last available ASYNC profile
     LI/NK                                        No
     RBT                                          No
     RBTD                                         No
     TY/PE = profile-type
     UR/P                                         No

     V/IRTUAL C/IRCUIT                            No
 
If no profile-name or options are specified all available ASYNC profile names
will be displayed.
