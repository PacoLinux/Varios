    WHAT.X displays most information the M$MONINFO call returns
(except MONPTRS) in a more or less readable format.  By default,
WHAT.X displays the SITE_ID which when run on the L66A or L66B at LADC
will say: 'You're on the L66x'.  Otherwise, it says 'Site ID= x'.  You
may also specify a specific group(s)(ex: MONINFO) or item(s)
(ex: SALUTATION) or ALL to get everything.
 
For a list of available options, type '?' or 'HELP (WHAT.X) TOPICS'
For a description of a specific option, type 'HELP (WHAT.X) option'
For a description of all options, type 'HELP (WHAT.X) A - Z'
In the list below, characters before the slash(/) are required.

                output symbiont file according to their granule size.
GRANS/CHED    = Indicates whether (~=0) OUTSYM assigns output symbiont
                file priorities by granule size or (=0) by submittal
                priority.
HE/ADER       = The administrative message seen in the logon header

                time of submittal, the file will be taken out of hold
                status and made a candidate for output.  HOLDEXPIRE is
                intended for use in situations where the system
                manager wishes to prevent files from being 'held' for
                arbitrarily long periods of time.  A value of zero
                specifies that no expiration is to be performed.
