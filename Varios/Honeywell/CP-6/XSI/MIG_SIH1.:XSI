MIG (Munge Index Granules) examines a keyed, indexed, or IREL file's index
granules to estimate how much space rebuilding the file would recover.
.*B* SYNTAX FORMAT
Syntax: !MIG.X sifid [(option-list[)]]
 
sifid = File to be analyzed.
 
Option-list = a MIG option.  Currently the only implemented option is SHARE.
 
MIG will then examine the file, and produce a report of the number of deleted
indices, and the amount of space that could be recovered by a rebuild of the
file.
.*K* OPTION OPTIONS
Type 'HELP OPTIONS option' for a description of a specific option, or type a
double question mark ('??') to get a list of all of them.
 
Legal options are
 
 SHARE          DETAIL          EXTENTS
 
The DETAIL and EXTENTS options are currently unimplemented.
 
Option        Description.
.*B* SHARE SH
SHare(op)       Open the file to be examined with the specified SHARE setting.
'op' may be ALL, IN, or NONE.  Note that if the user does not have FMSEC
privilege, SHARE(ALL) and SHARE(IN) will not allow him to examine the file.
The "(op)" part may be omitted, in which case SHARE defaults to ALL.
 
.*B* DETAIL DE
DEtail          Makes MIG print a detailed listing of index-granule statistics
for each alternate index of an index or IREL file.  This option is not
implemented.
 
.*B* EXTENTS EX
EXtents         Makes MIG print details of the extent list in the file's FIT.
This option is not implemented.
 
.*K* RESTRICTIONS PRIVS PRIVILEGES
MIG requires no special privileges to run.  However, if shared or compressed
files are to be examined, FMSEC privilege is needed.  If the user does not have
FMSEC, no shared or compressed files may be examined.
