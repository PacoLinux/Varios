1.  Introduction.
.fin
.spb
FLI (frame list integrator) is used to create the
basis for the screen image that the end user will ultimately
see; it does this by having the user "paint" the screen
with the form headings and identifying the location and
formats of the variable fields; FLI then uses this "painting"
to produce a FRAME-SECTION COPY file that is included in the
FPL program that will actually use the screen to accept input
or present output.  FLI can also change existing frame
definitions; in this case, the COPY file is read first and the
screen it represents is "painted" for the user, who may then
modify it as necessary.  At the end of a FLI session, an
updated COPY file is produced; up to 100 frames may be included
in a COPY file.
.spb
There are two steps to creating or updating a frame.  First, the
physical layout of the frame is defined by using the terminal
keyboard to "paint" the screen as it is to appear when used by
the FPL program.  The painting defines two types of
fields:  constants and variables.  Constant fields are used for
titles, prompts, etc.; variable fields are used to accept
input from, or display output to, the user.  The location of
both types of fields is determined by where the user drew
them.  The format of variable fields is determined by how the
user drew them.
.spb
The second step in creating a frame involves specifying details
about the fields identified in the first step.  Details include
visual attributes (reverse-video, high-intensity, blinking, etc.),
assignment of default values, and specification of whether user
input is required or not.  Each field may be handled separately,
and FLI presents the user with a menu of alternatives when
prompting for field details.
.fif
 
2.  Concepts.
.fin
.spb
FLI goes through three different phases to produce a frame.  First,
the COPY file to be created or updated is specified, along with
the name of the particular frame.  Second, the screen is painted,
identifying and placing the constant and variable fields.  Third,
the details of each field in the frame are specified.  When all
three phases have been completed, a new COPY file is generated.
.spb
Each phase is represented by its own distinctive form, or
screen:  the selection screen, painting screen, and detail
screen are described below.
.fif
 
2.1.  COPY file selection and frame activation:  the selection screen.
.fin
.spb
When first invoked, FLI presents the user with the "selection screen", which
allows the specification of one COPY file at a
time.  The user may "activate" one or more frames within
the COPY file, and create new frames.  Only
fields within active frames will be displayed
on the painting screen.  Similarly, fields displayed on the painting screen must
always remain associated with an active frame.
.fif
 
2.2.  Field painting:  the painting screen.
.fin
.spb
FLI operates on elementary fields within the user's COPY file
by displaying them on a "painting screen" in the same positions they
assume when used by a running FPL program.  From
FLI's point of view, there are two basic categories of
fields:  those with CONSTANT VALUE clauses, and those
without.  Fields with CONSTANT VALUE clauses appear on the
painting screen as the CONSTANT VALUE literal with underscores replacing
any blanks within the literal.  All other fields appear on
the painting screen as the field's PICture string written without
abbreviations (e.g., PIC $(7).9(2) appears as $$$$$$$.99).  The
user can add, update (shorten, lengthen, change the contents of,
move) or delete fields.  In
this way, FLI can determine, by examining a field on the painting
screen, the field's POSition clause, PICture clause, and CONSTANT
VALUE clause (if any).
.spb
The user's terminal's cursor must be positioned to various spots
on the painting screen in order to add or update a field (according to
rules described in section 3.2).  Keeping in mind that the
painting screen on which the fields are displayed is itself a collection
of 23 80-character FPL fields (this screen size limitation may
be removed after B03), some common cursoring sequences are:
.fif
.bbk
 
    Sequence                    Cursor destination
  CTL-I         Column 1 of the line below.
  CTL-H         Column 1 of the last line if currently in column 1;
                one column to the left if currently not in column 1.
  CTL-R         One column to the right if currently not in the last column;
                column 1 of the next line if in column 80.
  ESC-N         Column 80 of the current line.
  ESC-<return>  Column 1 of the current line.
 
.be
.fin
Note that the above sequences all retain their conventional
definitions; they are only noted here because their effects
on 80-character fields may seem "strange" at first.
.fif
 
2.3.  Field details:  the detail screen.
.fin
.spb
Each field displayed on the painting screen has associated with it
characteristics, described by FPL field clauses, which
FLI determines by querying the user.  This querying
is done when a field is added, modified, or selected to be updated, by
opening a temporary "detail window", on the backround of the painting screen,
that the user fills in.  Any FPL field clause can be specified
in this manner.
 
.fif
3.  Command syntax and description.
.fin
 
.fif
3.1.  Selection window syntax.
.fin
.spb
The selection screen is the first screen presented to the user
upon FLI invocation.  An "empty" selection screen appears as:
.fif
.bbk
 
Command:          Option:
New/Old (N/O):    File:
 
.be
.fin
.spb
The legal inputs for "Command:" are:
.inl 8
.unl 4
E[ND], Q[UIT], X:  Exits FLI.
.unl 4
AC[TIVATE]:  Allows the user to activate and deactivate frames by listing
all frames within the currently selected COPY file and prompting
the user to place a "Y" in front of those frames to be considered
active, and an "N" in front of those frames to be considered
deactive, for subsequent field painting.  Only legal after a COPY
file has been selected.
.unl 4
ADD:  Allows the user to define new frames
by listing all frames within the currently selected COPY file and
prompting the user for an additional frame-name, and for a
"Y" or "N" in front of the frame-name to determine whether the
new frame is to be considered active for subsequent field
painting.
.unl 4
ADJ[ACENT]:  When used with the "ON" option (see legal inputs
for "Option:" below), directs FLI to error the user if a field
which is:  1) taken from an existing COPY file; 2) moved; or
3) added is placed immediately adjacent to another field.  When
used with the "OFF" option, directs FLI to allow such fields.  The
default is "OFF".
.unl 4
P[AINT]:  Directs FLI to clear the selection screen, display any existing
fields within the current COPY file on the painting screen, and allow
the user to add, update, and select fields for modification
(see section 3.2).  Only legal after a COPY file has been selected,
and at least one frame has been activated.
.unl 4
3[270]:  When used with the "ON" option (see legal inputs
for "Option:" below), acts identically to the "ADJ[ACENT]" command
above, and additionally errors 1-character fields positioned in
the last column.  When used with the "OFF" option, directs FLI
to allow such fields.  The default is "OFF".
.spb
.inl 0
The legal inputs for "Option:" are:
.inl 8
.unl 4
O[FF]:  Turns off switch-type commands (see "ADJ[ACENT]" and "3[270]"
in legal inputs for "Command:" above).
.unl 4
O[N]:  Turns on switch-type commands (see "ADJ[ACENT]" and "3[270]"
in legal inputs for "Command:" above).
.spb
.inl 0
The legal inputs for "New/Old (N/O):" are:
.inl 8
.unl 4
N:  Directs FLI to build a new COPY file.  If a file of the same
name as that typed into the "File:" field (see "File:" below)
exists, an error is reported.
.unl 4
O:  Directs FLI to update an existing COPY file.  If no file of
the same name as that typed into the "File:" field (see "File:"
below) exists, an error is reported.
.spb
.inl 0
The legal inputs for "File:" are:
.inl 8
.unl 4
Any_valid_CP6_fid:  The name of the COPY file is input here.  The
contents of the field are then passed to M$FID, and any errors
are reported.  Whenever the contents of this field are changed,
FLI updates and closes the old COPY file (if any) and opens the
new one for updating.  Since FLI knows that no fields can be
added or updated until at least one frame is active, a "free"
"ACT[IVATE]" command will be issued for the user for "O"ld COPY
files, and a "free" "ADD" command will be issued for the user
for "N"ew COPY files (see "ACT[IVATE]" and "ADD" above in
legal inputs for "Command:").
.spb
.spb
.inl 0
3.2.  Painting screen syntax.
.spb
When given a "P[AINT]" command (see "P[AINT]" in legal inputs for "Command"
in section 3.1), FLI responds by clearing the selection screen and
opening a painting screen, on which is displayed any existing
fields within all active frames of the current COPY
file.  The user may then add, textually modify, and/or select for updating
any fields on the painting screen.
.spb
A request to return to the selection screen is signified by
pressing <return> without adding, modifying, or selecting any
fields on the painting screen.
.spb
Field addition is signified by the addition of characters where
spaces were before:
.fif
.bbk
 
    Old field:
    New field:  XXXXXXX
 
.be
.fin
Field modification is signified by overwriting the field's current
text with new text:
.bbk
.fif
 
    Old field:  XXXXXXX
    New field:  ZZZZZZZ
 
.fin
.be
and/or by shortening the left side of the field, and placing
a left bracket to the left of the result:
.fif
.bbk
 
    Old field:  XXXXXXX
    New field:    [XXXX
 
.be
.fin
or by lengthening the left side of the field, and placing
a left bracket to the left of the result:
.fif
.bbk
 
    Old field:     XXXXX
    New field:  [XXXXXXX
 
.be
.fin
and/or by shortening the right side of the field, and placing
a right bracket to the right of the result:
.fif
.bbk
 
    Old field:  XXXXXXX
    New field:  XXXX]
 
.be
.fin
or by lengthening the right side of the field, and placing
a right bracket to the right of the result:
.fif
.bbk
 
    Old field:  XXXX
    New field:  XXXXXXX]
 
.be
.fin
.spb
Field selection is a special form of field modification in which
no text is changed (the user may wish to update the details of
the field only).  Selection is signified by placing a left
bracket to the left of the field:
.fif
.bbk
 
    Old field:   XXXXXXX
    New field:  [XXXXXXX
 
.be
.fin
and/or by placing a right bracket to the right of the field:
.fif
.bbk
 
    Old field:  XXXXXXX
    New field:  XXXXXXX]
 
.be
.fin
 
.fif
3.3.  Details window syntax.
.fin
.spb
Once <return> is pressed after updates have been made to the
painting screen, FLI searches the painting screen from left
to right and top to bottom for field additions, modifications,
and selections.  Upon finding such a field, a detail window
is opened into which information concerning the field is
presented and allowed to be updated.  An "empty" detail
window appears as:
.fif
.bbk
 
Command:          Option:
Field-name:                                 Input (Y/N):    Output (Y/N):
In frame-name:                                 Entry required (Y/N):
A-O-I-M (Y/N):    Class (A/N/alphabet-name):
Minimum size:      Fill character:    Sign (LS/TS/TO):     BWZ (Y/N):
Constant/Default value (C/D):    Justified right (Y/N):
Attribute (EM/ER/H/I/N/O/W/attribute-name):
Repeats, across:     separated by:      Repeats, down:     separated by:
Prompt, type (D/L):    text (below):
 
 
.be
.fin
.spb
A request to discontinue updating the current field's details and to move on to the next field
is signified by pressing <return> after not updating any of the
current field's details.
.spb
The legal inputs for "Command:" are:
.inl 8
.unl 4
E[ND], Q[UIT], X:  Directs FLI to ignore any unprocessed field
additions, modifications, and selections, and return to the
selection screen (see section 3.1).  An addition, modification,
or selection is considered processed when it is recognized by
FLI, and a detail window for the field affected is opened.  Any
updates to the current field's details which were made simultaneously
to the E[ND], Q[UIT], or X command are also ignored.
.unl 4
DEF[AULT]:  Directs FLI to remove the detail window, turn the
line of the painting screen containing the current field reverse-video, and accept from
that line the text to be placed in the DEFAULT VALUE clause for
the field.  This text is typed over the current field's text.  Once
<return> is pressed, FLI returns the line of the painting screen containing the current
field to normal video, replaces the field's text, and re-opens
the detail window.
.unl 4
DEL[ETE]:  Directs FLI to erase the current field from the
painting screen, remove the detail window, and continue to search for
other added, modified, and selected fields.  The field will not
appear in the user's COPY file after it is updated.
.unl 4
L[IKE]:  Directs FLI to remove the detail window, turn the
painting screen reverse-video, and read the entire painting screen.  The
user places an "@" character on the leftmost character of a
field whose details have already been prompted for.  When <return>
is pressed, FLI returns the painting screen to normal video,
removes the "@", re-opens the detail window and places the
details of the field which was marked by the "@" in the
detail window.  The user may then tailor the details to
accommodate the current field (usually, the "Field-name:"
requires change).
.unl 4
M[OVE]:  Directs FLI to remove the detail window, turn the
painting screen reverse-video, and read the entire painting screen.  The
user places an "@" character where the leftmost character of
the current field is to be re-positioned.  When <return> is
pressed, FLI returns the painting screen to normal video
and attempts to move the current field to
the destination indicated by the "@".  An error occurs if the
current field's new position causes it to overlap one or more
fields, extend off the painting screen, or become immediately adjacent
to another field when the "ADJ[ACENT]" command has been
issued (see "ADJ[ACENT]" in legal inputs to "Command:" in
section 3.1).  If an error occurs, FLI will leave the current
field in the erroring position and "lock" the user onto the
current field until the error is resolved (via another "M[OVE]"
command) or an "E[ND]", "Q[UIT]", or "X" command is issued.  If
there is no error, FLI re-opens the detail window, and the
user is free to move on to another field.
.unl 4
PA[INT]:  Directs FLI to return to the painting screen without
searching through the remaining unprocessed field additions,
modifications, or selections.  (These unprocessed additions,
modifications, and selections are preserved on the painting
screen).
.unl 4
PI[CTURE]:  Directs FLI to remove the detail window, turn the
line of the painting screen containing the current field reverse-video, and accept from
that line the text to replace the current field's existing
text.  Once
<return> is pressed, FLI returns the line of the painting screen containing the current
field to normal video and re-opens
the detail window.

processing environment as described in section 5.

4.2.  COPY file selection.
.fin
.spb
When first invoked, FLI presents the user with the selection screen, and
reads for three fields prompted by
the texts "Command:", "Option:", "New/Old (N/O):", and "File:".  Suppose
a COPY file is to be created from scratch.  The user
fills in the fields following "New/Old (N/O):" and "File:":
.fif
.bbk
 
Command:          Option:
New/Old (N/O): N  File: ICK.RALPH
 
.be
.fin

4.3.  Frame creation and activation.
.fin
.spb
Since FLI knows that no fields can be added to a newly-created COPY file
without first ADDing a frame, a "free" ADD command is issued
for the user, who fills in the fields below the "Active" and
"Frame-name" titles:
.fif
.bbk
 
Command: ADD      Option:
New/Old (N/O): N  File: ICK.RALPH
 
Active           Frame-name
  Y     RALPHS-FIRST-FRAME
 
.be
.fin
If the user decides to ADD another frame, an ADD command can
be explicitly given:
.fif
.bbk
 
Command: ADD      Option:
New/Old (N/O): N  File: ICK.RALPH
 
Active           Frame-name
  Y     RALPHS-FIRST-FRAME
  N     RALPHS-SECOND-FRAME
 
.be
.fin
If the user decides to deactivate RALPHS-FIRST-FRAME and activate
RALPHS-SECOND-FRAME instead, the ACTIVATE command may be used,
and any fields below the "Active" title may be filled in:
.fif
.bbk
 
Command: ACTIVATE Option:
New/Old (N/O): N  File: ICK.RALPH
 
Active           Frame-name
  N     RALPHS-FIRST-FRAME
  Y     RALPHS-SECOND-FRAME
 
.be
.fin
 
.fif
4.4.  Field painting.
.fin
.spb
Suppose the user now decides to create some fields to be placed
in RALPHS-SECOND-FRAME.  The PAINT command is issued:
.fif
.bbk
 
Command: PAINT    Option:
New/Old (N/O): N  File: ICK.RALPH
 
Active           Frame-name
  N     RALPHS-FIRST-FRAME
  Y     RALPHS-SECOND-FRAME
 
.be
.fin
.bbk
At this point, the selection screen is cleared, and, since there are no
existing fields in RALPHS-SECOND-FRAME to display, the user is presented with a blank painting screen and allowed
to fill it in with new fields.  Suppose three fields
are added.  The 24-line painting screen (with the last line reserved as the message line) appears as:

FLI responds to the DEFAULT command in much the same way as
with a newly-added "D" in the "Constant/Default value (C/D):" field
seen in section 4.5:  the detail window is removed,
only the line of the painting screen containing the current field is turned reverse-video,
the current field's text is overwritten with the current DEFAULT
VALUE (this was not done in section 4.5, since no DEFAULT VALUE
previously existed),
and the user is allowed to fill in the new DEFAULT VALUE:

.fin

In response to the END command, FLI ignores any unprocessed
field additions, modifications, and selections (in this case, the "A_new_field"
field was not processed, and therefore will not appear on the
painting screen during any subsequent field painting, and will not appear
within the current COPY file after it is updated), returns to the selection screen, and again
queries the user concerning the COPY file:
.fif

In response to the QUIT command, FLI updates the current

.fif
5.  COPY file management.
.fin
.spb
FLI operates by reading in the user's entire COPY file and
parsing it (if it is a previously-existing COPY file), creating
an internal scratch file.  The user updates this scratch file
by various manipulations of the selection screen, painting screen, and
detail window.  When the COPY file "File:" name in the selection
screen is changed, or when the END, QUIT, or X command is issued
from the selection screen, the COPY file is permanently updated
with the information in the scratch file.
.spb
As an example, the COPY file called ICK.RALPH which was created
in sections 4.2 through 4.7 appears as:
.fif
.bbk
 
 
       FR  RALPHS-FIRST-FRAME.
       01  RALPHS-FIRST-FRAME-RECORD.
 
       FR  RALPHS-SECOND-FRAME.
       01  RALPHS-SECOND-FRAME-RECORD.
           02  RALPHS-CONSTANT-TITLE  OUTPUT;
                                      POSITION IS LINE 2 COLUMN 2;
                                      PICTURE IS X(32);
                                      CONSTANT VALUE IS "A constant titl
      -                               "e at position 2,2".
           02  RALPHS-X-FIELD-DOWN  REPEATS 3 TIMES SEPARATED BY 2.

                                   PICTURE IS X(5); CLASS IS ALPHABETIC;
                                   MINIMUM SIZE IS 5.
           02  RALPHS-9S-FIELD-DOWN  REPEATS 3 TIMES SEPARATED BY 2.
               03  RALPHS-9S-FIELD  I-O; ENTRY-REQUIRED;
                                    POSITION IS LINE 3 COLUMN 22;
                                    PICTURE IS $(4)9.99;
                                    MINIMUM SIZE IS 5;
                                    DEFAULT VALUE IS "$$123.45".
 
.be
.fin
There are a few general rules concerning FLI's COPY file
management:
.inl 8
.unl 4
1)  When a frame is added via the selection screen, FLI automatically
creates an 01-level group item below the frame and names the
item by concatenating the frame-name and "-RECORD".
.unl 4
2)  When adding a field to a COPY file, FLI adds the field as
the last 02-level item in the last non-elementary 01-level item
in the frame which the added field belongs.
.unl 4
3)  If an added field
requires a group item above it with a REPEATS clause so as to
repeat the field downward, FLI automatically creates it and
names it by concatenating the field-name and "-DOWN".
.unl 4
4)  When operating on an existing COPY file, FLI strips any
inheritable clauses from non-elementary 01-level items and
places them on the next higher-level items within the
group.  This is to ensure the ability to add 02-level items
(see point 2) containing any combination of clauses without
the possibility of having the clauses conflict with those
of the 01-level item.
.unl 4
5)  When operating on an existing COPY file, FLI retains any
intermediate group items.
.unl 4
6)  When operating on an existing COPY file, FLI does not retain
any comments.
.unl 4
7)  FLI cannot be coerced into creating repeated groups (see
"REPEATS CLAUSE" within "CLAUSES" of section 11 of the
FPL Reference Manual, CE51), but will retain any repeated
groups the user might already have.  The "separated by:"
values within the detail window for such fields will reflect
the actual separation shown on the screen, not that specified
on group level REPEATS clauses.  A change in the separation
value of such a field will result in the field being removed
from its repeated group.
.unl 4
8)  FLI ignores ENTRY-OPTIONAL and 'FILL CHARACTER IS " "' clauses
in existing COPY files.  It also converts the PICture clauses
of fields with "CONSTANT VALUE" clauses to PICture clauses of
all "X".
.inl 0
.spb
When updating a field in a COPY file, FLI simply replaces the
field at its current position, unless the field's updated
attributes conflict with those of any groups above it.  For
example, consider the following existing COPY file:
.fif
.bbk
 
 
       FR  RALPHS-OTHER-FRAME.
       01  RALPHS-OTHER-FRAME-RECORD.
           02  RALPHS-GROUP  INPUT.
               03  RALPHS-ELEMENTARY-1  POSITION IS LINE 1 COLUMN 1;
                                        PICTURE IS X.
               03  RALPHS-ELEMENTARY-2  POSITION IS LINE 2 COLUMN 1;
                                        PICTURE IS X.
           02  RALPHS-ELEMENTARY-3  OUTPUT;
                                    POSITION IS LINE 3 COLUMN 1;
                                    PICTURE IS X.
 
.be
.fin
If RALPHS-ELEMENTARY-1 were changed from INPUT to I-O, it would
then conflict with the INPUT clause on RALPHS-GROUP.  In this
case, when updating RALPHS-ELEMENTARY-1, FLI would place it as
the last 02-level item in RALPHS-OTHER-FRAME-RECORD:
.fif
.bbk
 
 
       FR  RALPHS-OTHER-FRAME.
       01  RALPHS-OTHER-FRAME-RECORD.
           02  RALPHS-GROUP  INPUT.
               03  RALPHS-ELEMENTARY-2  POSITION IS LINE 2 COLUMN 1;
                                        PICTURE IS X.
           02  RALPHS-ELEMENTARY-3  OUTPUT;
                                    POSITION IS LINE 3 COLUMN 1;
                                    PICTURE IS X.
           02  RALPHS-ELEMENTARY-1  I-O; POSITION IS LINE 1 COLUMN 1;
                                    PICTURE IS X.

6.  FLI installation.
.fin
.spb
The interactive portion of FLI is in itself an FPL program
communicating with a host program which handles I/O to the
COPY file and a scratch file (for internal use).  The
overall system appears as:
.fif
.bbk
 
               _______________    _______________     __---__
               |             |    |             |    |  ---  |
               |             |    |             |--->|  COPY |
  _______      |             |    |             |<---|  file |
 |       \     |             |    |             |     --___--

Running FLI as a timesharing forms program is the recommended
mode, since no precursory steps are required, the transaction
processing comgroup overhead is avoided, and the user need not
log off to run it.
.fif
.fin
The remainder of this section describes the particulars of FLI
when installed in a transaction processing environment.
.fif
.fin
FLI's TPAP, FLI.X, is run as a PERM TPAP.  FLI's
forms program writes the TPAP a message type which is the concatenation
of the text "FLI-" and the first four characters
of the station name.  For example, for station RALPHTP1, FLI's forms program
would write message type "FLI-RALP".  The TPAP writes RESPonses
back to the forms program.
.fif
.fin
Assuming the user in account "RALPH,RALPHNAME,RLPHPASS" has no existing TP instance, the steps for
installing FLI would be as follows.
.fif
.fin
First, the user's account is authorized to run in GHOST mode:
.fif
 
    !SUPER
 
    *** CP-6 SUPER C00B00 ***
 
    CMD*MODIFY RALPH,RALPHNAME
    OPT*ACCESS GHOST=YES
    OPT*END
    CMD*
 
.fin
Second, the FLI station is created:
.fif
 
    CMD*CREATE DEVICE RALPHTP1
    OPT*USE=TP; INSTANCE=RALPH; PROFILE=VIP7801
    OPT*END
      RALPHTP1 created.
    CMD*END
 
    ***  NO Errors  ***
    ***  NO Warnings ***
 
 
.fin
Third, the system parameters are set to allow the TP instance
to run:
.fif
 
    !CONTROL
    CONTROL HERE
    -SET UM(TP)=10
    -SET TPI=RALPH
    -SET MAXTPU(RALPH)=10
    -END
 
.fin
Fourth, the user's TRADER file is created:
.fif
 
    !TRADER
      TRADER C00 here
    CMD? SELECT RALPHS_TRADER_FILE
      New TRADER file
    CMD? CREATE FORM FLI FP=FLI_FORM.X
    CMD? CREATE ENTRY FLI-RALP TPAP=FLI.X, SETS
    SET? READS FLI-RALP THRU M$SI
    SET? END
    CMD? END
 
.fin
Fifth, the user's default TPA commands are prepared:
.fif
 
    !BUILD X:TPA
    EDIT C00B00 HERE
        1.000 !DEL RALPH.RALPH
        2.000 !SET M$TRADER RALPHS_TRADER_FILE
        3.000 !TPA
        4.000 LET MCTID=RALPHTP1
        5.000 TRANS TYPE=FLI-RALP,PERM=1
 
.fin
Sixth, the TP ghost is started:
.fif
 
    !GOOSE
    :START RALPH,RALPHNAME,RLPHPASS USING !XEQ X:TPA
    Ghost started with sysid: 019563
    :END
 
.fin
Last, the user logs onto RALPHTP1 and use the "BEGIN FLI" command
(see section 4.1) to begin the FLI session.
.fif
.fin
If FLI is to be incorporated into an existing TP system, all
that is necessary is the addition of a TRADER FORM for FLI and an ENTRY for each station
to be authorized for FLI:
.fif
 
    !TRADER
      TRADER C00 here
    CMD? SELECT RALPHS_TRADER_FILE
    CMD? CREATE FORM FLI FP=FLI_FORM.X
    CMD? CREATE ENTRY FLI-RALP TPAP=FLI.X, SETS
    SET? READS FLI-RALP THRU M$SI
    SET? END
    CMD? END
 
.fin
Along with a TPA TRANS command for each corresponding FLI message
type:
.fif
 
    !EDIT X:TPA
    EDIT C00B00 HERE
    *IP4.1
        4.100 TRANS TYPE=FLI-RALP,PERM=1
    *X

7.  Helpful hints.
.fin
.spb
Since FLI operates on COPY files, and any number of COPY files
may be specified in FPL, the user's FPL program might read as:
.fif
.bbk
           .
           .
           .
       FRAME SECTION.
           COPY RALPHS-FIRST-COPY-FILE.
           COPY RALPHS-SECOND-COPY-FILE.
 
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
           .
           .
           .
.be
.fin
Each COPY file may contain as many as 100 frames, but for large
programs with many screens, it is advisable to break up the
FRAME-SECTION into smaller COPY files, as this will speed up FLI's
response time.  As a general rule, if two frames are mutually
exclusive, i.e., if FLI will never be used to update both at
the same time on the painting screen, then they should be placed
in separate COPY files.
.spb
Things to note:
.inl 8
.unl 4
1)  Since FLI adds fields as the last 02-level items
in the last 01-level record within the frame being added to,
the user is forced to post-edit the COPY file if the fields
were intended for a previous 01-level record.  This can be
avoided by creating only one 01-level record per frame.
.unl 4
2)  Two adjacent fields cannot be added during a single read of
the painting screen, as FLI will consider them to be one field
run together.  Such fields must be added in two separate
painting screen reads.
.unl 4
3)  The characters "[", "]", and "@" have special meaning to FLI
and are therefore not allowed in CONSTANT fields.  They are
replaced by "<", ">", and "&", respectively, in much the same
way as all "_" characters are replaced by spaces when the
COPY file is updated.
.unl 4
4)  FLI makes no attempt to verify the uniqueness of
frame-names or field-names.
.unl 4
5)  FLI allows PICture strings with "V" characters in
existing COPY files, but discards them when updating the COPY file.  PICture strings with
"V" characters typed onto the painting screen are considered
illegal.
.unl 4
6)  Level numbers of fields in existing COPY files are allowed
to increment by any step (e.g., 01, 05, 10, 15, etc.), but FLI
will always re-increment them by 01 when updating the COPY
file (01, 02, 03, 04, etc.).
.unl 4
7)  FLI parses the user's COPY file one frame at a time.  It
is possible that the frame may contain too many characters
for the P_PCB.NCHARS field.  If this happens, FLI will inform
the user.  Also, since FLI recognizes the end of one frame
and the beginning of the next by finding "FR" in column 8, it
is very important to be sure that all frame definitions begin
in the correct column.
.unl 4
8)  FLI maintains a sequence number within its scratch file
which is used to read the file sequentially.  The algorithm
for calculating sequence numbers for added fields should present
no problems for normal FLI usage;
however, if FLI informs the user that its scratch
file is full, the user should immediately return to the
selection screen, exit FLI, and re-invoke FLI.  This will
cause any unprocessed changes on the painting screen to go
unnoticed, but should ensure scratch file integrity.
.unl 4
9)  If FLI encounters an internal error while updating a COPY
file, it aborts the updating and attempts to create a file in
the account which the COPY file resides whose name is the
concatenation of "FLI_ERROR_" and the message type.  For
example, the FLI installation described in section 6 would
create a file called "FLI_ERROR_FLI-RALP".  If this file
is ever created, it should be saved and BEAMed to LADC as
supporting documentation for a STAR.  The user's COPY file
is not updated in this case.
.unl 4
10)  It might be wise for the user
to save a copy of the COPY file before entering FLI
until the user becomes familiar with FLI, and FLI with the
user.
