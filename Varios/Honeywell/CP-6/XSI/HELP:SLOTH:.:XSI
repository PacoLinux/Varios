Syntax:
PA/CK [=] packname
Parameters:
packname    specifies the name of the pack on which to work.  It may be
            enclose in quotes or slashes if non-standard characters are
            needed.
Description:
This command is used to change the packset name for SLOTH.  Upon entry, SLOTH
is working on CP-6'S.
END
Syntax:
RESET [ { AL/L | SL/OTS | SC/OUNT } ]
Description:
This command resets selected portions of the dump slot information to known
(i.e. zero) values.  ALL (the default) means both SLOT information and  SCOUNT
information.  One or the other may be reset by using the appropriate option.
The new dump slot information is displayed after it is reset.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: The RESET command should only be used when other more
conventional (e.g. running RCVR2 online) means of clearing the dump slots have
failed.  It should only be necessary after the dump slot headers have been
fouled up by a hardware failure or the 35811 bug (which only comes into play
when the size (not number) of dumps is too big.)  Please do not abuse this
command, as it will make later analysis of the problem impossible.  RESET ALL
or RESET SCOUNT resets only the dump number to zero.  Any important 'current
letter' dumps should be renamed before issuing this command.
Syntax:
TE/ST [ { AL/L | SL/OTS | SC/OUNT } ]
Description:
This command functions exactly like the RESET command, but the new information
is not written to disk.
