HEAD will convert a B03 run-unit to a C00 run-unit, and back again.
The syntax for using HEAD is:
     !HEAD.X  fid [ ( B03 | C00 ) ]
 
where "fid" is the name of the run-unit to be converted.
 
If the version id is specified on the command line, HEAD will make sure that
the run unit ends up as that flavor of run unit, rather than swapping back and
forth.
 
By default, though:
 
If the run-unit has a B00/B03 head record it will be converted to a C00 head
record. Also fixes EDEF, SDEF, INTNTRY, and EXST records.
 
If the run-unit has a C00 head record it will be converted to B00/B03.
