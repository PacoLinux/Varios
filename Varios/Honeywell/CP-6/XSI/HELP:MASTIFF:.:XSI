Syntax for MASTIFF source records is:
 
      {:HOST}
      {:FEP } = string of ANLZ commands separated by semicolons
      {fcg  }
 
 :HOST specifes the default commands for host dumps.
 :FEP specified the default commands for fep dumps.
 fcg specifies the default commands for dumps with a screech code
      of 'fcg'.  Note this may be 2 or 3 letters.  ANLZ will first
      try to match the 3 char fcg-mid from the screech code to
      a record in ANLZ_STAR, if that fails, it will try using
      just the first two char fcg, if that fails, it will use
      the commands from the default HOST or FEP record, whichever
      is appropriate.
