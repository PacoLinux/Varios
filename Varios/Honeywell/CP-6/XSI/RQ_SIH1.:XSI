.*K* ALL
Syntax: A/ll
.*B*
The A/ll command (equivalent to 'SE/arch A/ll') causes subsequent
queue inquiries to access the Input and Running queue.  This
is what RQ wakes up with as a default.
.*B*
This will effect what data gets printed on subsequent Find,
Number, Print and/or Tally commands.
.*B*

.*B*
Display allows the selection of which fields to print via subsequent
Find or Print commands.  If fieldname1 is omitted, a title line
of the current display headings will be printed.

.*B*
Example: EV/ery
  Say you wanted to monitor the output queue and print information
(EVery 60 seconds for 10 minutes) about the currently outputing
job(s).  The following commands might be used:
  -Output;System;EVery 10*60;Find DEVName <> ' ';ENDEvery
    or fully abbreviated:
  -O;S;EV 10*60;F DEVN<>' ';ENDE
    where:
      O        selects the Output queue
      S        scan any and all output items
      60       is interval, in seconds
      10       is number of interations
      F DEVN<>' '  says Find items with DEVice Name not equal to

.*B*
Find, similar to FT in EDIT, allows the user to have only those
entries (if any) printed that meet the selected criteria.
.*B*
All the specified conditions must be true in order for the entry
to be selected (ie. the comma between the conditions serves as a
implied AND).
.*B*
Example: F/ind
  Say you wanted a list of all the DEFERRED jobs that were submitted
after 12:00 today.  The following series of RQ commands may be used:
  -System
  -Display ACcount,SYsid,SUbmitted,Deferred,Job name
  -Find RA=Y,SUbmitted>12:00
    or fully abbreviated:
  -S                  " Look at everyones jobs "
  -D AC,SY,SU,D,J     " Select what fields to print "
  -F RA=Y,SU>12:00    " RA indicates job must Run After a specified "

.*K* '!'
Syntax: !xxx ...
.*B*
 xxx = Either, a valid fid to M$LINK to passing 'xxx ...' in CMD
       buffer or a legal IBEX command to be passed to a M$YC
       monitor call.
14 lines of Help remain: 3 + 5 + 5 + 1
.*B*
This command allows you to issue a M$LINK or M$YC from within
RQ. This allows you, for instance, to SPY on a specific user that
is running without exiting RQ.
.*B*
First, it is assumed that you wish to M$LINK to xxx with 'xxx ...'
passed in the CMD buffer.  If M$LINK ALTRETurns with an error of
'xxx does not exist' then 'xxx ...' is passed to M$YC.  If M$YC
ALTRETurns or M$LINK ALTRETurns with other than the aforementioned
error, then the error is printed and RQ continues.
.*B*
Example: !
  Say after using RQ to look at the running jobs you were curious
how your own running job was doing and you wanted to SPY on it.
You might issue the following:
  -!SPY A=ZZZLHMAR
.*B*
No more Help is available for !.
.*K* INPUT
Syntax: I/nput

.*K* ME
Syntax: M/e

.*K* NOTATION
Documenting conventions used in this Help:
Uppercase letters (ABC...) must be typed as shown.
Lowercase letters (abc...) indicate user-supplied values
  except when they follow a slash in which case they are
  optional (ie.  in 'AC/count' the 'count' is optional where as
                 in 'fid' the fid is user-supplied)
Special characters (#@.,) must be typed as shown.
Brackets ([]) indicate an optional field.
Braces ({}) indicate a required choice.
The Or bar (|) separates choices inside brackets and/or braces.
.*B*
Example: D/isplay [ fieldname1 [, fieldname2...] ]
D is required, 'isplay' is optional.  fieldname1, fieldname2...
if present, are user supplied.
.*K* 'OUTPUT-ON-NO'
Syntax: [O/utput] [O/n] NO
.*B*
Directs most of RQs subsequent output to NO
27 lines of Help remain: 3 + 3 + 19 + 2
.*B*
Subsequent Find or Print commands produce a summary line on ME
of how many items where searched and or listed.  All other
commands produce no output on ME.
.*B*
This is handy when you are after finding out how many items
satisfy certain criteria but you don't really want to see the
items.
.*B*
Example: NO
  Say you just BATCHed a job and it is waiting 250 to run.  Being
not to happy about this you wonder what partition(s) your job
qualifies for and how many other jobs qualify for the same
partition.  You could use the following RQ commands:
  -System;All;Find SYsid=your-jobs-sysid
  -Output NO
  -Find PArtition=?partition#?
  -Output ME
    or fully abbreviated:
  -S;A;F SY=your-jobs-sysid
  -NO
  -F PA=?partition#?
  -O ME
    where:
      your-jobs-sysid  is sysid of your BATCHed job
      partition#       is a partition that your job qualifies for
The above will produce a line such as:
  20 items listed, 256 searched
.*B*
No more Help is available for the NO command.  Help on
HE/ad, O/utput [O/n] fid, [O/utput] [O/n] LP may be useful.
.*K* NUMBER
Syntax: N/umber [{ .[account] | @[wsn] | form }]
.*B*
Gives a summary of how many jobs/items are in the queue currently
being SEarched.
13 lines of Help remain: 5 + 6 + 2
.*B*
If SEarching the Input and/or Running queue(s), the total number
of jobs in the queue is printed followed by the number of jobs at
each priority present(in the queue).  If SEarching the Output
queue, the total number of items in the queue is printed followed
by the number (of items) for each device at each WSN.
.*B*
Example: N/umber
  -System  " Looks at any entries in queue "
  -All     " Look at input and running queues "
  -Number
Might result in a line such as:
3 Jobs: 1 At zero priority, 1 Running, 1 Deferred

    The following are Display defaults:
 
    For the Input and/or Running queues:

.*K* RUNNING
Syntax: R/unning
.*B*
The Running command (equivalent to 'SE/arch R/unning') causes
subsequent queue inquiries to access the Running queue.
5 lines of Help remain: 2 + 3
.*B*
This will effect what data gets printed on subsequent Find, Number,
Print and/or Tally commands.
.*B*
No more Help is available for R/unning.  Help on A/ll, F/ind,

.*B*
SCan controls who's jobs will be considered.  Me means only look
at your own jobs.  All, if user is AUTHorized the DISPJOB
privilege, means look at any jobs or output in the queue.

.*B*
SEarch controls which queues will be SEarched.  This will effect
what data gets printed on subsequent Find, Number, Print and/or
Tally commands.
.*B*
Example: SE/arch
  -SEarch All " This is what RQ wakes up with "
  -SE O       " This is used to look at the Output queue "

.*K* XEQ
Syntax: X/eq fid
.*B*
  fid = the fid of a file containing RQ commands.
14 lines of Help remain: 4 + 8 + 2
.*B*
Causes RQ commands to be read from 'fid'.  If you want RQ to exit
when done reading 'fid', make the last command in 'fid' a E/nd,
Q/uit or X/it.  Otherwise, RQ will prompt the user for more
commands when EOF is hit on 'fid'.
.*B*
Example: X/eq
  Say you don't like the default fields displayed on the Print
command for the Input queue.  You could set up a Display command
with the fields that you wanted in the order you wanted them.
The following might be put in a file (call it RQ):
  >Di AH,AC,SY,US,A,F,O,MA,M,SP,9T,PA
then to use it, just type:
   -X RQ
.*B*
No more Help is available for the X/eq command.  For further
help, type 'H;?'.

.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
08/06/85
.*R*
    Changed references from VLP_TRMATTR.HEIGHT# to VLP_TRMATTR.DSPHEIGHT#.
.*B*
09/26/84
.*R*
    Changed references from VLA_JOBSTATS_OSRCH.TNAME to VLA_JOBSTATS_OSRCH.WOD
    so WSN/TNAME/WODs would display as something besides garbage in C00.  Also
    changed the DISPLAY/PRINT of the NUM output field to adjust to six digits
    IF needed (per STAR #18469).  This effect can be negated by issuing a
    'O;F NUM>1000' command instead of a PRINT command.  Also got rid of four
    STATIC arrays and made them dynamic.  This should prevent RQ from Memory
    Faulting when there are more than about 400 items in the output queue.
    A summary line for the TALLY output was also added.
.*R*
07/09/84
.*R*
    Made some cosmetic changes to some of the summary messages making
    them easier to spot in a listing.  Also added code that will make RQ
    truncate output through M$LO based upon the value of M$LO->F$DCB.WIDTH#.
    If this value is zero, a value of 132 will be the default.
.*R*
10/19/82
.*R*
    Made the FIND command aware of the P1-8 fields (Pseudo resources) to
    allow item selection based on the value of the Pseudo fields.
