LAP.X (Look At Pput), will list the good, the bad, and the suspect memory pages
on a system.
.*B*
Syntax:
   !LAP.X
.*B*
LAP displays the pages that are marked as good, bad, or suspect from the PPUT
(Physical Page Usage Table).  The display is much easier to read than that
produced by SYSCON.  Users must have SPCLMM or EXMM privilege turned on in
order to use LAP.
