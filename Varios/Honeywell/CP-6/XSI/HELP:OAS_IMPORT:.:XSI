OAS_IMPORT aids in converting OAS data files to CAP format.
Full command line syntax:
 
 !XEQ OAS_IMPORT.X X=file
 
where:
 
file
     is the name of a OAS file that has been moved to CP6.
 
file is assumed to exist in the user's FMACCT, and a file named CAP_file will
be created when OAS_IMPORT is done.
OAS files can be moved to CP-6 by a number of techniques, but the recommended
technique is to make an ANSI-labelled tape for the transfer.
 
OAS_IMPORT.X does NOT automatically make a CAP source file.  It AIDS in the
one-way conversion of OAS files to CP-6 CAP format.
 
OAS_IMPORT leaves the character '#' in the text when it gets confused.  That
means that any OAS file imported with this technique (I won't even call it a
tool) must be manually edited to verify that any '#' characters left in the
file are supposed to be there.
 
It is known that OAS "table mode" is not converted properly by this XEQ file.
No provisions have been made for cross-account conversions, and there's no way
to change the name of the output file on the XEQ line.
 
In other words, this is a silly little thing that I just threw together to
import some files, and dumped in .X when I was done.  End of tune.
