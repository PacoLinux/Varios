The FUMBLE processor uses a master list of substitution and
selection parameters, and skeleton JCL files to build a BATCH
command image.  The BATCH command image is then optionally sent
to IBEX for execution.

10/31/91 - PAR - make it use XUG and *CONTINUATION_COMMANDS, so that long
     invocation lines are possible (the list of COMP selections has grown).

Changed M$YC to pass only the leading non-blank portion of the command to
IBEX, rather than passing the entire 256-character command buffer (avoids an
X$EVAL problem involving preprocessing).

SELECTION
SYNTAX
The inputs to and outputs from FUMBLE are given below:
 
FUMBLE is driven from a list of substitution and selection parameters
in a user supplied file called the LISTFILE.  The layout of the
LISTFILE is as follows:
 
  name,jclfile[.jclacct],select_name[,select_name...][;sub_string;] comments
 
   where
 
         name      is a special substitution parameter for X, ie.
                   X=name will be added to the end of the string
                   substitution list built by FUMBLE.  It is usually
                   used for the name of a source file for compilation
                   JCL files.  It may also be used as an extra
                   selection name, since only those names found in
                   the STD file will be considered for batching.
 
         jclfile   is the fid for the skeleton JCL file to be batched
                   by this LISTFILE record.
 
         jclacct   is the account portion of the jclfile FID.  If it
                   is not specified, the current FMA is assumed.  The
                   field can be overridden by the JCLACCT option of the
                   FUMBLE command.
 
         select_name  is up to ten 31 character selection names
                   for this LISTFILE record.  A LISTFILE record will
                   be batched only if one of its select_names matches
                   a name in the SELECT option of the FUMBLE command.
                   If no SELECT option is given, the select_names are
                   ignored, and the record is used to build a BATCH command.
         ;sub_string;  The string will be used to make up the second
                   part of the substitution string field of the BATCH
                   command built by this LISTFILE record.  Both ';'s are
                   required, but they are not included in the string.
                   Imbedded ';'s are not permitted in the string.
                   There is no syntax checking on this field.
 
         comment   is ignore by fumble.
 
The listfile record may be up to 120 bytes in length.
 
 
INPUTS
FUMBLE requires a keyed LISTFILE.  The keys are 31 bytes long, and contain
the name of the LISTFILE record.  If the LISTFILE is not keyed,
FUMBLE will build a scratch file containing keyed records.
If your LISTFILE is more or less stable, i.e., you use it more
often than you add to it,  you should use the BUILD option.  This
option will build a keyed LISTFILE from a consecutive or EDIT
keyed LISTFILE.  The syntax is given below:
 
     !FUMBLE listfile (BUILD=fid)
 
INPUTS
NOTE: All of the FUMBLE options can be abbreviated to 2 characters.
 
      !BATCH commands passed to IBEX are limited to 255 characters;  if FUMBLE
      constructs a !BATCH command longer than this limit, the command will be
      truncated by IBEX, and incorrect results will occur.
 
Options are separated by commas and may be any of the following:
 
     STD=fid   fid is the name of a standard file.  The standard
          file contains the names of records to be selected from the
          LISTFILE, one name per record.  The default is the same fid
          as LISTFILE, ie. all records in the LISTFILE will be selected.
          It is sometimes useful to say STD=ME.  This allows input of
          names from the terminal.
 
     SEL(select_name[,select_name...])  After a LISTFILE record is
          selected via the STD file, the select_names are compared with
          the select_names in the LISTFILE record.  If any name on
          the SEL option matches any name in the LISTFILE record, the
          record is batched.  If SEL is not used, all records selected by
          the STD file are batched.  Up to ten 31 character names may be
          given, separated by commas eg. SEL(DELTA,XDELTA).
 
     JCLACCT=acct  acct adds or replaces the jclacct field of the
          LISTFILE record.
 
     SUB(string) or SUB[string]     string is a character string of up
          to 120 bytes in length.  The string will be added to the string
          substitution portion of the !BATCH command image build by FUMBLE;
          any substitutions specified via the SUB option will override any
          identically-named substitutions contained in the listfile record.
          The string specified may not contain the character used to terminate
          the string (i.e, if "SUB(string)" is used, "string" must not contain
          a ")" character;  similarly for "SUB[string]");  aside from this
          restriction, "string" may contain any sequence of characters, and
          is not checked for legality by FUMBLE (but will be checked by IBEX
          when the !BATCH command is issued).
 
     X=name  Selects name from the LISTFILE and batches it.  If SEL or
          STD are specified, they are ignored.
 
     MAXQ=n  n specifies the maximum number of jobs that FUMBLE is
          to place in the batch Q at a time, ie. FUMBLE will keep
          n jobs in the Q.  ***NOTE***  Until IBEX returns the sysid
          of a job batched with M$YC, FUMBLE can not tell how many of
          its jobs are in the Q.  For now, FUMBLE will batch n jobs,
          and then exit.  n more jobs can be batched using the RESTART
          option described next.
 
     RESTART=name  name is the STD name of the last record batched.
          FUMBLE will maintain a file containing the !FUMBLE invocation
          line, and an appended RESTART=name to enable automatic restart
          when the system crashes.  This automatic restart procedure
          will be available when IBEX returns the sysid of jobs
          batched with M$YC.  Until then, you can use the RESTART
          option to control the number of jobs batched as follows.
          Use the MAXQ option to batch n jobs.  Record the name of
          the last job batched.  Use that name to append a RESTART=name
          option to the MAXQ option to batch another n jobs from the STD
          file.  name is always the name of the LAST job batched,  the STD
          file will be positioned to the record after the record containing
          the restart name.
 
     T    If T is specified as an option, FUMBLE will not call M$YC,
          it will only print the !BATCH image thru M$LO.  This allowes
          the user to check his options before actually batching 500 jobs.
 
     SYSID=fid  fid is the name of a file into which will be written
          the SYSIDs and names of the modules batched.  If the file
          already exists it will be appended to; if it doesn't exist
          it will be created.
 
     SILENT    If specified, FUMBLE will not write the !BATCH command through
          M$LO before submitting the command to IBEX.
 
The BATCH command built by FUMBLE is derived and ordered as follows:
 
   !BATCH jclfile.jclacct listfile_subs,suboption,X=NAME
 
         where
 
         jclfile and jclacct are as explained above.
 
         suboption is from the SUB option of the FUMBLE command.
 
         listfile_subs is the sub_string given in the LISTFILE record.
 
         name is from the LISTFILE record as explained above.
 
 
OUTPUTS
Bill Huckeba, LADC
A record is selected from the LISTFILE to be batched if:
 
         1) Its name is given in the X option of the FUMBLE command
or
         2) its name is given in the STD file
            and
            One of the select_names matches one of the names given
            in the SELECT option of the FUMBLE command.  All records
            match if no SELECT option is given; however the name
            of the LISTFILE record must appear in the STD file.
 
 
The FUMBLE command is passed on the invocation line as follows:
 
   !FUMBLE [listfile] [(options)]
 
     listfile is the fid containing substitution and selection parameters,
          the LISTFILE.  If not specified, the default is ':LIST' in the
          current FMA.
