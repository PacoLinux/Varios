CBAU is the administrative user for the comgroup used by CB.  CBAU must be
running to use CB.  Both CB and CBAU must reside in the same account.  CBAU
create the comgroup CBCG in the account in which the run units reside.  The
account under which CBAU is run must be authorized to create files in that
account and the account in which the run units reside must be authorized for
sufficient CGMEM.  CBAU is normally run as a ghost.
