  !EJECT.X [dest] [,dcb-name] [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO} ,DCB4]
.*B*
where:
  dest      is the destination, default is ME
  dcb-name  is the DCB to be used, default is M$LL
  DCB4      is the same as 'dest' above except that it is in the standard
               position on the invocation line were listing DCBs usually appear
.*B*
EJECT.X positions 'dest' to a new page by issuing a Top Of Form through
DCB 'dcb-name'.  If 'dest' is omitted, 'ME' is assumed.  If 'dcb-name' is
omitted, 'M$LL' is assumed.
.*B*
Examples:
  !EJECT.X           " Writes a Top Of Form to 'ME' through DCB M$LL "
  !EJECT.X LP        " Writes a Top Of Form to 'LP' through DCB M$LL "
  !EJECT.X ,M$LO     " Writes a Top Of Form to 'ME' through DCB M$LO "
  !EJECT.X *LS       " Writes a Top Of Form to '*LS' using DCB M$LL "
