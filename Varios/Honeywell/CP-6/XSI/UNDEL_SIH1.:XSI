UNDEL, under some circumstances, may restore records that were deleted from a
file.
.*B*
UNDEL is invoked as:
 
!UNDEL fid
 
.*B*
UNDEL must be installed in :SYS in order to work properly.  UNDEL can only work
on Keyed and Indexed files.
 
UNDEL is only able to restore deleted records under certain circumstances.  If
a record was deleted, and a new record was written with the same, or similar
key, then the File Management system will have probably reused the space from
the deleted record to store the new record.  So, UNDEL will not be able to
undelete the deleted record.  Also, any time all records have been deleted from
a file, File Management will reclaim the entire file, and no records may be
undeleted from the file.
 
.*B*
Once you are in UNDEL, there are several commands you may specify.
 
You may undelete a key.  A key may be specified as an octal key, a text key, or
an EDIT key.
 
.*B*
Octal keys may be specified as either:
 
 .n[n. . .]
 
or as:
 
 'n[n. . .]'O
 
For example:  .123456 and '123456'O are octal keys.
 
For keyed files, the first byte specified will be taken as the key size, with
the remainder of the value used as the key value.  For Indexed files, the
entire specified value will be used as the key value.
 
.*B*
Text keys are specified as:
 
't[t. . .]'
 
For example: 'ABC' is a text key.
 
For keyed and indexed files, the entire text value will be used as the key
value.  The length of the text will be used for the size byte for Keyed files.
 
.*B*
Edit keys are specified as:
 
n[nnnn][.nnn]
 
For example:  1.234 and 12 are EDIT keys.
 
Key ranges may be specifed as: key - key.  For example, 1.234 - 12.  may be
specified as a key range.  UNDEL will attempt to undelete all keys within the
specified range.
 
.*B*
The "ALL" command will undelete all records in the file that can be recovered.
 
The "REV[IEW]" command allows you to select which records you wish to undelete.
UNDEL will go through the file one record at a time, presenting the key and
record to you in the most appropriate format.  Only the first 256 bytes of the
record will be displayed.  You will then be prompted to either keep or delete
the record.  The command "K[EEP]" will undelete the record.  The command
"D[ELETE]", or simply a carriage return will leave the record as it was.  The
command "Q[UIT]" will return you to the normal UNDEL command level.
 
.*B*
"Q[UIT]" or "E[ND]" may be used to exit UNDEL.
