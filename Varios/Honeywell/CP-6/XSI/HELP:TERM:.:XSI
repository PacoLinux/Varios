TERM tells you which remote terminals and devices are connected and/or have
output queued for them.
Invocation syntax:
 
!TERM.:SYS [term_spec]
 
TERM responds by showing the name of each indicated terminal, its FEP, channel,
and subchannel (if any), its connect time, its "status" (Active means output
exists, Idle means no output exists), and its attachment type.  If the device
is a TP terminal, its instance name will be displayed in brackets at the right
margin.  For a symbiont device or console, its device name and WSN will appear
there, and for a comgroup device, the comgroup name will be shown.
 
"term_spec" specifies the selection of items to be displayed.  It may be any
individual terminal name (containing no "/", "@", or "#").  Or, it may select
devices by comgroup ("CG/comgroup"), TP devices by instance ("TP/instance"),
symbiont devices by WSN ("@wsn"), or other devices by type ("#type").  If
"comgroup", "instance", "wsn", or "type" is omitted, then all devices of the
indicated type are selected.
 
If an individual terminal is selected, TERM will tell you the status of the
terminal and set the STEPCC in accordance with the terminal status.  The status
to stepcc relation is:
 
 0 If terminal was connected and active.
 1 If terminal was connected but idle.
 2 If terminal was not connected but no output is queued for it.
 3 If terminal was not connected and output is queued for it.
More than one term_spec may be specified (separated with commas), however the
STEPCC will reflect the status of only the LAST specified terminal.
Examples:
 
!TERM.X
 
This will give you the status of all the terminals on the system, omitting
individual symbiont devices of connected workstations.
 
!TERM.X ALPHA
 
This will give you the information on just terminal or device ALPHA, setting
STEPCC accordingly.
 
!TERM.X TP/
 
This will give you information on all TP devices on the system.
 
!TERM.X #ASYNC
 
This will give you information on all Async-flavored devices on the system.

4/18/91 - Fixed 40860, traps with >100 terminals attached.
10/11/90 - PAR.  Fixed star 40329 - TERM device didn't reflect existing output.
5/17/89 - [PAR] Added CG/, TP/, @, and # keywords for input.  Updated display
to include CG name and symbiont devnm and wsn.
850729 [JLJ]
Updated to correctly print subchannels and subsubchannels.  If a TP device,
logon and instance name are now shown.  The bug of saying SYNC SUB-DEV all the
time is now fixed.  All Dtypes are now mixed case, with more accurate contents.
Internals reworked so a common output routine is used.
07/01/83
Updated to add line numbers.
