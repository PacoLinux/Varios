    The BASS (Batch And Symbiont Spy) processor looks at symbiont files in the
act of or waiting to PRINT, BEAM, PUNCH or whatever.  What a user may examine
depends on what privileges that user is authorized.  At the very least, the
user may look at their output (that is, output created by their current logon
account).  If the user has either FMREAD and/or FMSEC privilege, they may look
at anyones output.  If the user has DISPJOB, FMREAD and/or FMSEC then they may
LIST anyones output.  The LIST command returns certain information about the
output but doesn't allow the user (if they only have DISPJOB) to actually
examine the output.
.*B*
 BASS may be invoked as follows:
  !BASS [cmd-file] [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO},listing] [( [cmds] [)]]
 where:
  cmd-file  is a file containing BASS command(s) (default is ME)
  listing   is where BASS's primary output will be directed (default is ME)
  cmds      is one or more BASS commands, separated by semi-colons.  If nothing
            follows the '(', then a 'List .' command is the default.

Description:
     Indicates the user wants to see files containing nothing but a BANNER.
.*K* DVBYTE
[DI/SPLAY] DV/BYTE
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     The DVBYTE command causes the DVBYTE information to be printed when
     the TO (Type Octal) command is issued.  The DVBYTE information indicates
     whether the record has BINary and/or TRANSparent information.  The length
     of the record, in bytes, is also printed.
 
     The DVBYTE command is the default but may be reversed via the NO DVBYTE
     command.
.*K* DISPJOB FMREAD FMSEC
{ D/ISPJOB | FMR/EAD | FMS/EC }
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     Indicates that when the user does a subsequent LIST command, the user
     wants to search the entire queue and not only their own items.  If either
     of these PRIVileges are turned ON when BASS is invoked, this command will
     be simulated when BASS is invoked.  See the ME command to reverse this
     commands effects.
.*K* END end
{ EN/D | X/IT | Q/UIT }
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     Exits BASS unless specified inside a READ file in which case the READ file
     is exited and M$SI is read.
.*K* EXAMINE examine LOOK look
EX/AMINE what
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     Identifies the item to be examined.  "what" must identify ONE and only ONE
     item.  If it does not, BASS will tell you how many items were found and
     ask you to try again.  If "what" is omitted and the previous LIST command
     only found ONE item, then that item will be EXamined.  For a description
     of "what" type 'Help WHAT' if you are currently in BASS or 'Help (BASS)
     WHAT' if you are not.
.*K* FIDS
[DI/SPLAY] FI/DS
.*B* DESCRIPTION
     When specified, this option causes the symbiont file name to be displayed
     when subsequent EXAMINE or STATUS commands are issued.  The effects of
     this command may be reversed by the NOFIDS option.  The default is NOFIDS.
.*K* FIND find FT ft
F/IND [rec1] [-] [rec2] [,] /string/ [,[column1[,column2]]]
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     The FIND command searches records "rec1" through "rec2" for an occurrance
     of "string" in columns "column1" through "column2".  If found, the record
     is typed out using the last form of the type command (TY,TS,TC,TO) used.
     If no form of the type command has been used since the current file was
     opened (EXAMINED) then the default is a TC (Type Compressed).  By default,
     the comparisons are case sensitive, meaning "string" must occur in the
     record EXACTLY as specified before the record is selected.  The compare
     may be made case insensitive by issuing the UC command.
.*K* HELP help
H/ELP [(processor)] [ TOPICS ][ keyword1 ][ - ][ keyword2 ]
.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
 processor is the processor or program for which HELP is being requested.  If
           not specified, BASS is assumed.
 TOPICS    requests a list of available HELP TOPICS for the current processor.
           The range of TOPICS is determined by "keyword1" and "keyword2".
 keyword1  specifies the name of the topic or message to be printed.
 keyword2  if a range is specified (by including a dash), keyword2 is the upper
           limit of the range.  If a range is not specified, "keyword2" is a
           submessage, or category within a message.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     Requests either a brief description of BASS (or "processor" if specified)
     or information about the specified command.
.*B* EXAMPLES
Examples:

FMREAD (so it can see .:SYMO) and FMDIAG (so it can do block reads).
.*K* INTERPRET
I/NTERPRET [S/PECIAL] [R/ECORDS]
.*B*
     This command will cause BASS to "interpret" certain records within a
     symbiont file.  To be specific, those records containing "platen"
     information (first byte of record is '033'O) and records containing "tab"
     information (first byte of record is '021'O).  The effects of this command
     may be reversed via the NO INTERPRET command.  The default is
     INTERPRET.

  device  specifies the possibly wildcarded device (LP,JE,etc.) that requested
          item(s) are destined for.
  wsn     specifies the possibly wildcarded wsn that the requested item(s) are
          destined for.
  form    specifies the possibly wildcarded form name that the requested
          item(s) must be using.
  not     has the form 'NOT', '~' or '<>' and negates the clause it precedes.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     The LIST command lists the sysid-num, number of granules, number of
     records, number of pages, destination device and wsn, jobname and account
     for any items found that meet the specified criteria.  For additional
     limiting criteria, see the SYSTEM and ME commands.

N/O B/ANNER
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     Indicates the user does NOT wish to see the BANNER in the file(s)
     EXAMINEd.  Thus, all record numbers specified are relative to the end of

.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
     Directs BASS to start reading commands from 'fid'.  When either an END or
     end-of-file is hit, BASS goes back to reading the original command stream
     (i.e.  what was being read before the READ command was issued).  Please
     note that READ commands may NOT be nested.
.*K* RIGHT
RI/GHT = value
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
