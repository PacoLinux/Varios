KEYUP.X is a tool to put usable EDIT keys on records in update packets.
.*B*
KEYUP keys a file of plus records and update records in a fashion suitable to
the Common Update Package. It also validates the file to insure that it is in
proper form and optionally adds a common comment to any '+n[,m]' records
without a comment. The comment comes from the command line. i.e.,
.*R*
!KEYUP.X PLUS_FILE (RTS (5/8/83)
.*R*
will add 'RTS 5/8/83' to all +n[,m] records without comments already.
.*B*
KEYUP reads a plus record and writes it out as record n.000 with the update
records immediately following with key x.xxx where xxx is grown by an increment
suitable to allow all updates to fit in the range provided.  If the input file
begins with a non plus record, a '+0 KEYUP-SUPPLIED' record is provided. A
'+END' record is also supplied as the last record if one was not provided. In
any case, the '+END' record gets the key 99999.999.  If the file is malformed
in any way, the input file is unchanged and an M$ERR is issued making the
STEPCC=4.
.*B* DCB_USAGE DCBS M$SI M$DO M$OU
Input is through M$SI, output through M$OU, and diagnostics through M$DO. The
name of the input file along with all file attributes are carried to the output
file.
.*B* SYNTAX INVOCATION_SYNTAX
To use KEYUP.X on an update packet file named UPDATE_PACKET:
.*R*
!KEYUP.X UPDATE_PACKET [(optionlist)]
.*B* OPTIONS
KEYUP accepts the following options:
 
     C[OMMENT], I[NCREMENT]
 
If a list of options is specified and it doesn't match one of these everything
upto the next ',' or ')' is treated the same as the C option.
 
   !HELP (KEYUP.X) OPTION optionname
 
for further information on these options.
.*B* C COMMENT
C[OMMENT]=text - The text is a default comment for each plus card
                 that does not already have a comment.
.*B* I INCREMENT
I[NCREMENT]=.integer - The maximum increment to use for update records.
                       The number must be between .1 and .001.
.*K* DCB_USAGE DCBS M$SI M$DO M$OU
