DFILES tells you what files were deleted (and deletion times) since
       the last DUAL ALL/SAVE ALL operation.
 
       DFILES can be used 2 ways:
 
       1) Non-privileged users may search their own accounts with
          the syntax:
 
              !DFILES.X
 
       2) FMSEC users may search lists of accounts and/or packs.
          The syntax for this use is:
 
              !DFILES.X fid,fid,fid....
 
           Where fid can be .<account name> or DP#<pack name>
 
           NOTE: specifying DP#BOZO/.:CLOWN will cause the entire
           BOZO pack to be scanned.
One final note: DFILES must be called DFILES in order to work properly.
