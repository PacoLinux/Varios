FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

This HELP file is large, so you might find using LISTHELP necessary, too.
.*K* DESCRIPTION PURPOSE
SQ - Screen driven Queue munger - produces a dynamic display of the system's
tape drives and JOB/OUTPUT queues.  During program execution, SQ divides the
user's CRT into four vertical sections and displays the following information
in each section:
 
 
TOP SECTION (depth = 3 screen lines)
.*R*
------------------------------------
.*R*
o  Current ETMF and 90% Response Time.
 
o  Total system users; which is the sum of all Online, Batch, Ghost, and TP
users.
 
o  Total new mail messages in the :MAILBOX in your file management account.  If
the total is > 0 (zero), SQ flags this field with four asterisks (****).  If SQ
is unable to open :MAILBOX (e.g.  %E$FILEBUSY or %E$NOFILE), this field is
filled with three question marks (???).
 
o  Current time and date.
 
 
.*B*
TAPE SECTION (depth = variable)
.*R*
-------------------------------
.*R*
For users with SPCLMM or EXMM privilege, this section of the screen displays
the status of the operating system's tape drives.  For a given drive, the
following information fields are available:
 
o  DEVC, device name.
 
o  DDTFLGS, which may be any combination of the following one-character flags:
 
   "A"        --> drive loaded with ANS tape.
   "S"        --> drive loaded with SCRATCH tape.
   "E"        --> drive loaded with EBCDIC tape.
   "W"        --> drive's tape volume is open and WRITE is allowed.
   "L"        --> drive's tape position is LOST due to I/O or operator
                  error.  Further I/O attempts will be ignored until
                  the tape is unloaded and remounted.
   "F"        --> drive's tape position is FUNNY and not valid for
                  further I/O due to attempted volume change to volume
                  which does not exist.  Differs from lost position in
                  that FUNNY position is reset when the volume is next
                  opened for input since a reasonable position can be
                  found.
   "X"        --> drive loaded with EXPIRED ANS tape.
 
.*B*
o  SYSID, this drive's CP6-assigned sysid (user).
 
o  ACCOUNT, sysid's account.
 
o  STATUS of tape drive or its mounted volume.  Possible values include:
 
   "Free"     --> drive is empty--no tape mounted, no user assigned.
   "*Part*"   --> drive is partitioned--out of service, kaput.
   "Alloc"    --> CP6 has assigned a user to this drive, but no tape
                  is mounted.  This state occurs when a user requests
                  a tape drive from the system (!RES or !ORES command)
                  and CP6 Allocates a free drive for that purpose.
   "Mount"    --> A CP6 user has requested a tape mount.  The user's
                  sysid may be found in the previously described SYSID
                  field.  The serial number of the requested tape may
                  be found in this section's SERNUM field.
 
Note:  Just because sysid XXXXX's requested mount is associated with a
system-allocated drive, MT01 for example, there is no guarantee that XXXXX's
tape will be mounted on MT01.  Tape mounts occur at the discretion of the
operator.
 
.*B*
   "Undetr"   --> Mounted tape's position is Undetermined or unstable.
   "BgnVol"   --> Mounted tape is at Beginning of Volume.
   "Header"   --> Mounted tape is at tape Header.
   "BgnDat"   --> Mounted tape is at Beginning of Data, after group
                  and file mark.
   "ChkLab"   --> Must Check next Label on mounted tape to determine
                  tape position.
 
Note:  If a drive's SYSID and ACCOUNT are blank and its STATUS field contains
some value other than "Free" or "*Part*", then no CP6 user has been assigned to
this drive (tape volume).  Instead, the operator has in all likelihood AVR'd an
"unsolicited" volume.  Unsolicited volumes are often mounted during EFT
incrementals and saves.
 
o  SERNUM, mounted volume's serial number.  If this drive's volume is mounted
scratch and its serial number is blank, SERNUM will be filled with "Scrtch".
 
o  RNG, tape ring flag.  For mounted tapes, this attribute has two possible
values:
 
   "*Y*"      --> tape mounted WITH ring.
   "-N-"      --> tape mounted WITHOUT ring.
.*B*
o  DENS, mounted tape's density.  If DENS is 0 (zero), this tape is either
blank or else so badly garbled that it could not be read during AVR.
 
o  V, mounted tape's Volume access (VOLA).  This field only applies to labeled
tapes created on CP6.  Attribute values include:
 
   "A"        --> VOLA = ALL
   "I"        --> VOLA = IN
   "N"        --> VOLA = NONE
 
o  BLOCKS, number of tape blocks read from (written to) the current FSN of the
mounted volume.
 
o  CFSN, Current File Sequence Number of the mounted tape volume.  This field
is meaningful only for labeled tapes.
 
o  FFSN, First File Sequence Number of the mounted tape volume.  This field is
meaningful only for labeled tapes.
 
o  OWNER, mounted tape's owner.  This field is meaningful only for labeled
tapes.
 
 
.*B*
JOB SECTION (depth = variable)
.*R*
------------------------------
.*R*
This section contains those items found in the JOB queue.  If your account has
DISPJOB privilege, you may look at all jobs.  If not, you may only look at your
jobs (if any).  For a given job, the following attributes are displayed:
 
o  STATUS, which may be any of the following values:
 
   "Running"
   "Deferred"
   "PSN Wait" --> job needs a packset to run.
   "Follows"  --> this job follows another job.
   "nn Ahead" --> job is waiting to run.
   "Part'nd"  --> job partitioned, resource unavailable.
   "Other Q"  --> Known only to Bull.
 
o  IP, Input Priority.  Jobs at higher priority will run before jobs at lower
priority.  Jobs at IP=0 will never run unless the operator changes their
priority manually.
 
o  SYSID, batch job sysid.
 
o  ACCOUNT, batch job account.
 
.*B*
o  Job card flags, including:
 
   "O" --> order flag
   "A" --> account flag
   "D" --> deferred flag
   "F" --> follows flag
 
   Type   !HELP JOB   for a description of these flags.
 
o  MAX TIME, maximum CPU required by this job.  For Running jobs, MAX TIME is
decremented to reflect actual CPU remaining.  Display format = hhh:mm:ss, with
leading zeroes suppressed.
 
o  9T, number of tapes required by this job.
 
o  SP, number of (diskpack) spindles required by this job.
 
o  JOB NAME/DEFER DATE.  For non-Deferred jobs, this field is filled with the
job's jobname (if any).  For Deferred jobs, this field is filled with the job's
defer date and starting time (format = mmm dd 'yy  hh:mm).
 
 
.*B*
OUTPUT SECTION (depth=variable)
.*R*
------------------------------
.*R*
This section contains those items found in the OUTPUT queue.  If your account
has DISPJOB privilege, you may look at all output items.  If not, you may only
look at your output (if any).  For a given OUTPUT item, the following
attributes are displayed:
 
o  STATUS, which may be any of the following values:
 
   "Printing"
   "nn Ahead" --> waiting to print
   "Prio 0"   --> never prints
   "Hold"     --> needs M$JOBSTATS ORDER=UNHOLD to print
   "Spilled"  --> Known only to Bull.
   "Other Q"  --> Ditto.  Sure, why not?  Me too.
   "M-F Wait" --> Ditto.  ZZZzzz...  Awesome.
 
o  SYSID-nnn
 
SYSID is the sysid of the user who created this item. "nnn" is the symbiont
file number associated with item.  If nnn is greater than 999, it is replaced
with '**'.
 
.*B*
o  ACCOUNT, account of the user who created this item.
 
o  CPYs, item copies to be printed.
 
o  GRANS, item size in granules.  (One granule = 4096 bytes.)
 
o  FORM, name of required device form.
 
o  TrmNAME, destination terminal name on which this item will print (is
printing).
 
o  JOBNAME, jobname of the batch job which created this OUTPUT item.  If the
creator was not a batch job, this field is usually blank, but can be
(inconsistently) filled with a name via MSUCS's !JOBNAME utility.
 
.*B*

.*R*
mail:
.*R*
M/AIL [I/NTERVAL] [=] mins      specifies how often SQ counts new
                                mail messages in :MAILBOX.FMA .
                                Default = 15 minutes.
.*R*
priv:
.*R*
{D/ISPJOB | M/E}                specifies initial state of the DISPJOB
                                privilege.  Default = DISPJOB ON (if
                                authorized).
.*R*
both:
.*R*
B/OTH [:jobq] [:outputq]        signifies that both the JOB and OUTPUT
                                queues are to be displayed.  BOTH is
                                the default display mode.  If 'B/OTH'
                                is optionally followed with a colon
                                (:), the user may specify job and/or
                                output queue criteria for SQ's
                                displays.  If job queue criteria is
                                omitted, all jobs found in the job
                                queue are candidates for display.  If
                                output queue criteria is omitted, all
                                output items found in the output queue
                                are candidates for display.
 
                                Note:  Job and output queue criteria
                                may be specified in either order.
.*R*
job:
.*R*
J/OB (job_type)                 specifies JOB queue selection
                                criteria.  If this option is not
                                specified as a subordinate qualifier
                                of the BOTH option (i.e. used as a
                                stand-alone option), SQ will only
                                display job queue items.
.*R*
outputq:
.*R*
O/UTPUT (out_type,...out_type)  specifies OUTPUT queue selection
                                criteria.  If this option is not
                                specified as a subordinate qualifier
                                of the BOTH option (i.e. used as a
                                stand-alone option), SQ will only
                                display output queue items.
.*R*
maxjobs:
.*R*
MAX [J/OBS] [=] value           when BOTH queues have been selected
                                for display, this option determines
                                the max number of jobs that may be
                                displayed on the screen when the
                                OUTPUT queue contains a large number
                                of items.  Default value = 5;
                                permissible range is 3-14.  tapes:
.*R*
{T/APES | NT/APES}              for users with SPCLMM or EXMM
                                privilege, this option determines
                                whether or not SQ displays tape
                                drives.  The default causes tape
                                drives to be displayed.
.*R*
maxtapes:
.*R*
MAX [T/APES] [=] value          when the TAPES option has been set,
                                this option determines the max number
                                of tape drives that may be displayed
                                on the screen.  The default is 5;
                                permissible range is 1-20.
.*R*
free:
.*R*
{F/REE | NF/REE} [D/RIVES]      specifies whether or not SQ displays
                                free (empty) tape drives when the
                                TAPES option is set.  The default is
                                NOT to display free drives.
.*R*
partn:
.*R*
{P/ARTN |NP/ARTN} [D/RIVES]     specifies whether or not SQ displays
                                partitioned (kaput) tape drives when
                                the TAPES option is set.  The default
                                causes such drives to be displayed.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
job_type:
.*R*
{EXECUTING | HIBERNATING | INCUBATING | UNIVERSE | ZAPPED}
 
E/XECUTING (sic) selects only running jobs.
.*R*
H/IBERNATING (sic) selects only deferred jobs.
.*R*
I/NCUBATING selects only those jobs waiting to run.
.*R*
U/NIVERSE selects all entries in the job queue (Default).
.*R*
Z/APPED selects only those jobs trapped in a no-run partition.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
out_type:
.*R*
{LOCAL|WORLD} | {STDLP|NSFORM|ALLFORMS} | {0-15P|1-15P|2-15P |
                                                   @user defined}
 
L/OCAL selects only those items destined to print on local terminals.
.*R*
W/ORLD selects items destined to print on any terminal (Default).
.*R*
@      selects only those items destined to print on your defined
       terminals. ie.  '@LADC'   or  '@REID303'.
 
S/TDLP selects only those items destined to print on form STDLP.
.*R*
N/SFORM selects only those items destined to print on "not STDLP" forms.
.*R*
A/LLFORMS selects items destined to print on any form (Default).
 
0/-15P selects output queue items at priority 0-15.
.*R*
1/-15P selects output queue items at priority 1-15.
.*R*
2/-15P selects output queue items at any priority (Default).
 
Note:  The final output selection criteria is a logical ANDing of the three
possible choices listed above.  Therefore, the default out_type consists of
those items destined to print on any terminal (WORLD), on any form (ALLFORMS),
and at any priority (2-15P).
 
 
 
.*K* EXAMPLES
Examples:
 
!SQ.X (DISPJOB,MAIL INTERVAL = 3, REPORT INTERVAL = 30)
 
means turn on DISPJOB, count new mail every 3 minutes, and update the screen
display every 30 seconds. BOTH queues displayed (all queue items eligible for
display--default).  Display up to 5 tape drives for privileged users (default).
 
 
!SQ.X (D,M3,R30
 
means the same as the previous example.
 
 
!SQ.X (RI=40,BOTH
 
means display BOTH queues (all queue items eligible for display) and update the
screen every 40 seconds.  DISPJOB turned on if possible (default).  Mail
counted every 15 minutes (default).  Up to 5 tape drives displayed for
privileged users (default).
 
.*B*
!SQ.X (RI=10,OUTPUT(LOCAL,STDLP,0-15P),MAX TAPES=8)
 
means display those items in the OUTPUT queue that are designated to print on
LOCAL terminals loaded with form STDLP; each item's priority must lie between 0
and 15, inclusive.  Mail counted every 15 minutes; display updated every 10
seconds.  DISPJOB turned on if possible.  Up to 8 tape drives displayed for
privileged users.  No jobs displayed.
 
 
!SQ.X (ME,JOB(EXECUTING),RI=5,NT)
 
means look at MY running jobs only (no DISPJOB).  Screen display updated every
5 seconds; mail counted every 15 minutes.  No tape drives displayed.  No output
queue items displayed.
 
 
!SQ.X (B:O(N):J(E),NPARTN
 
means display BOTH queues, selecting OUTPUT queue items that are at any
priority level and designated to print on the WORLD's terminals; terminals must
be loaded with an NSFORM (not STDLP).  Also, display those jobs in the job
queue that are EXECUTING (running).  Mail counted every 15 minutes; screen
updated every 20 seconds.  DISPJOB turned on if possible.  Up to 5
non-partitioned tape drives displayed for privileged users.
.*K* KEYINS
 
SQ accepts a multitude of one-stroke keyins during program execution.  A
majority of these keyins permit users to change the criteria that select queue
items for screen display.  Several other keyins perform miscellaneous tasks not
related to queue displays.
 
A summary listing of SQ keyins is presented next.  (Remember, these are
one-stroke keyins.  Do not terminate them with an activation character!)

.*K* RESTRICTIONS LIMITATIONS
TERMINAL LIMITATIONS
 
Being a simple-minded program, SQ cannot be run from just any terminal.  The
following list details SQ's minimum operating requirements:
 
o  You must invoke SQ from a CRT-type terminal whose profile has been properly
set.  SQ simply will not run on a hardcopy terminal.
 
o  Your CRT must be at least 79 columns wide.  If not, SQ's display will be
truncated on the right.
 
o  Your CRT must have at least 24 vertical lines.  If not, SQ will behave very
erratically (when it doesn't abort).
 
 
PROGRAM LIMITATIONS
 
SQ presently has no keyins to scroll its tape drive displays.  Perhaps such a
feature will be added in the far distant future.
