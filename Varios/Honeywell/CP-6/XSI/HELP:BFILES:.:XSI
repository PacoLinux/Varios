BFILES tells you what files are considered 'bad' by the operating
       system.
 
       BFILES can be used 2 ways:
 
       1) non-privileged users may search their own accounts with
          the syntax:
 
              !BFILES.X
 
       2) FMSEC users may search lists of accounts and/or packs.
          The syntax for this use is:
 
              !BFILES.X fid,fid,fid....
 
           Where fid can be .<account name> or DP#<pack name>
 
           NOTE: specifying DP#BOZO/.:CLOWN will cause the entire
           BOZO pack to be searched.
NOTE: BFILES must be called BFILES to work properly.
