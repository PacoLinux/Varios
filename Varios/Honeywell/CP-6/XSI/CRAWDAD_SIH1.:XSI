FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=80)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
CRAWDAD is a CReator of Alternate Ways to Display and Analyze Data.  CRAWDAD
creates records in a keyed file consisting of control strings for use with the
X$FORMAT Host library data display service.  It also has an interactive mode
that can be used to edit the output records it produces.
.*B*
Command line syntax:
    !CRAWDAD.X [fid1] [,fid2] [{ON|OVER|INTO} [fid3] [,fid4]] [(optionlist)]
 
    fid1 specifies the fid that contains the source.
    fid2 specifies the fid that contains source updates.
    fid3 specifies the fid to contain the output records.
         (defaults *G, type=Dd)  
    fid4 specifies the fid of the listing output destination.
.*B*
Type HELP (CRAWDAD.X) TOPICS for a list of related topics.  Help is available
for X$FORMAT by typing HELP (HOSTLIB) X$FORMAT.  CRAWDAD makes use of the
standard PL-6 preprocessor.  Type HELP (PL6) PREPROCESSOR for additional
information on the PL-6 preprocessor or refer to Section 12 of Manual CE44-01,
the CP-6 PL-6 Reference Manual.
.*B*
For information on the help facility type HELP HELP.
.*K* OPTIONS
Help is available for the following CRAWDAD options:
    BC        CSYS      EDIT      LS        LO        LU
    NLS       NLO       NLU       NMAXIMUM  NOU       NSO
    NSYS      NUI       OPTUI     OU        RECSIZE   SO
    SRCH      SYS       UI
 
Type HELP (CRAWDAD.X) OPTIONS option for help on a specific option.
.*B* BC
BC[(list)]     - specifies which compile units from the source file are to be
processed.
.*B*
The list is a sequence of numbers indicating units to be processed, separated
by commas, or is the word ALL.
.*B*
The compile units in the source file are delimited by the preprocessor
directive %EOD.  The default is BC(ALL).
.*B* CSYS
CSYS           - specifies production of a system file on the M$SYSTEM DCB from
all MACRO, MAC, SET, EQU and SUB preprocessor commands in the first compile
unit.  Subsequent compile units in the same file will be processed with the
newly built system file.  This is off by default.
.*B* EDIT
EDIT           - CRAWDAD edits the SI file in interactive mode.  This option
allows specification of other options, like RECSIZE and NMAXIMUM, that would
otherwise disable the interactive mode.  The default is compile mode.
.*B* LS NLS LO NLO
[N](LS|LO)     - List or don't list the source program.  The default is LS
unless any other options are specified.
.*B* LU NLU
[N]LU          - List or don't list the update file before listing the source.
The default is NLU.
.*B* NMAXIMUM
NMAXIMUM=n     - Specifies the maximum value that can be entered for the
control word in the output records.  A value of zero indicates that the control
word is not present.  The default is 1024.
.*B* OU NOU
[N]OU          - Write or don't write the output file.  The default is OU,
unless any options are specified and there is no OU file specified.
.*B* RECSIZE
RECSIZE=n      - Specifies the maximum record size in bytes that will be
written to the output file, permitting the programs that use the records to
have a fixed buffer size.  The default is 1900 bytes, which permits editing on
a 24x80 CRT.
.*B* SO NSO
[N]SO          - Write or don't write new source through M$SO.  The default is
NSO.
.*B* SRCH
SRCH (list)    - This option augments the specification of the accounts and
packsets to be searched if CRAWDAD encounters an INCLUDE preprocessor directive
which specifies a file only by file name.
.*B*
The list is a list of accounts, possibly qualified by packset, separated by
commas.  Each account designation must have a leading period.
.*B*
A maximum of eight accounts may be specified.  If the file is not found in any
of these accounts, the :LIBRARY account and the user's running account will
then be searched.
.*B* SYS NSYS
[N]SYS         - specifies use of a system file, if present, using M$SYSTEM
DCB.  The default is NSYS.
.*B* UI NUI OPTUI
([N]UI|OPTUI)  - Use, do not use, or conditionally use update input.  The
default is NUI unless a UI file is specified on the invocation line.  If OPTUI
is specified, a UI file is used if it exists.
.*K* INPUT_FORMAT
Source input to CRAWDAD conforms to PL-6 conventions for statement continuation
and termination, and commentary.  It also accepts any PL-6 preprocessor
directives or expressions.  Each CRAWDAD statement defines one FMT string for
use with X$FORMAT, using the following format:
 
fmt-name / n-value = fmt-string(s);
.*B*
The key used to write the FMT string to the output file is specified by
"fmt-name", the characters of which must be legal in a PL-6 identifier.
.*B*
"n-value" is a decimal number that is converted to binary and placed in the
first four bytes of the output record.  It is limited in value by the NMAXIMUM
option.  If NMAXIMUM=0 is specified on the command line, then both the slash
and the n-value portion of a statement are not permitted, and the actual FMT
string text begins at the first byte of the output records.  The true meaning
of "n-value" is dependent on the program that will be used to access the output
records.  For ANLZ, the value determines the number of words of memory to
present to X$FORMAT in the data vector.
.*B*
"fmt-string" is a quote-string, preprocessor expression, or any other non-blank
text.  PL-6 comments (e.g., /*-comment-*/) and blanks outside of quote strings
are ignored, even if they are imbedded in a PL-6 expression evaluation.
.*B*
Note that the terminating semi-colon must be the last non-commentary item on a
line.  Also, since both X$FORMAT and the PL-6 preprocessor are invoked by the
percent character, any X$FORMAT functions must necessarily be entered by means
of a quote string.
.*K* EDIT_MODE
When directed at an SI-file whose ORG is keyed and whose TYPE is 'Dd', with no
options or other command line files specified, CRAWDAD will allow interactive
users to edit the FMT strings contained in the file.
 
Four commands are available: List, Build, Edit, and Quit.
.*B* LIST
   L/IST
.*R*
The List command displays the names of the FMT strings in the file.
.*B* BUILD
   B/UILD fmt-name
.*R*
The Build command adds new FMT strings to the file.
.*B* EDIT
   [E/DIT] fmt-name
.*R*
The Edit command presents the specified FMT string for re-read mode editing.
.*B* QUIT EXIT XIT END
   (Q/UIT|E/XIT|X|E/ND) returns to IBEX.
.*K* EXAMPLE
The following CRAWDAD program could be used with ANLZ to display the settings
of a user's FMSEC and FMREAD privileges:
 
%INCLUDE B$JIT_E; /* Built by DRAW.X using the PL6 and BIT=4 options */
 
PRIV_DISPLAY/%(B$JIT_PRIV_ACTIVE#/36+1) /* Tell ANLZ how much JIT is needed */
 
= '%.1C' /* Define a subroutine to display the ones that don't match var1 */
.*R*
   '%2...' %B$JIT_PRIV_ACTIVE_FMSEC# 'P' /* Position to the FMSEC flag */
   '%1N:1#\(Fmsec, %)' /* Display 'Fmsec, ' if the flag doesn't match var1 */
   '%2...' %B$JIT_PRIV_ACTIVE_FMREAD# 'P' /* Repeat for the FMREAD flag */
   '%1N:1#\(Fmread, %)'
   '%:2-X' /* Backspace over the trailing comma (or blanks) */
   '%C' /* End of subroutine */
 
'On:  %1C' /* Display the "on" ones (var1 defaults to zero) */
.*R*
'%/Off:  %1.1=%1C' /* set var1 to 1, to display the "off" ones */
.*R*
'%1Q'; /* All done, return to ANLZ */
