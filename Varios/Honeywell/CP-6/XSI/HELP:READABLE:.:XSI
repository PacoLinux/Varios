Syntax:
 
    !READABLE.X textfile [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO} ,listfile]
 
where "textfile" contains the text to be analyzed.  M$SI is used to
read the text source, and M$LO is used to report the analysis
results.
READABLE estimates the required education level for understanding a
passage of text.
 
This is computed according to three algorithms: Flesch, Kincaid, and
FOG.
 
The Flesch index (R. Flesch, 1948) is a relative readability
rating.  The higher the Flesch index, the more readable the document
is supposed to be.  The Flesch grade level is an attempt to
translate the readability rating into a required grade level for
understanding.
 
The Kincaid grade level (J. Kincaid, 1970) was intended to be an
improvement upon the Flesch grade level.  Both the Flesch index and
the Kincaid index are calculated based upon the average number of
words per sentence and average number of syllables per word.
 
The FOG grade level (R. Gunning 1952) adds the premise premise that
words of three syllables or longer are "harder" to read than words
of two or one syllable.
 
The grade levels in READABLE are expressed according to the United
States public school grade levels.  The Flesch and Kincaid indexes
tend to be more forgiving than the FOG index.  READABLE's conclusion
is based upon the FOG index.
The advantages of such formulae are that they are not subjective and
can be easily automated.  In addition, MIL-M-38784A, Amendment 5
recommends the use of readability formulas.
 
On the other hand, readability formulas ignore organization,
environment, typography, and word choice, all of which can greatly
affect the readability of text.  Further, it's disputable that
reading grade level is a linear function of word and sentence
complexity.  In short, READABLE results should be taken relative to
other stylistic considerations.
READABLE is intended primarily for source textual documents written
for CP-6 TEXT or any other RUNOFF-like language.  READABLE ignores
blank lines or lines that begin with a period.  If a record contains
any of the following characters: }{][|= only the portion of the
record preceding the first encountered illegal character and the
portion of the record following the last encountered illegal
character are analyzed.  For example:
 
        How doth the {little}=crocodile
 
is perceived as:
 
        How doth the crocodile
 
Colons and semicolons are included as valid sentence delimiters.
READABLE results can be slightly higher for passages that are
underscored, although in most cases the error factor will be
negligible.  READABLE also knows about FASTEXT macros.
Just in case you're interested, this HELP file scored 12.
