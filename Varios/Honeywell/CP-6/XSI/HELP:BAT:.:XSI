BAT (Bannertext Access Tool) either reports BANNERTEXT contents or creates JCL
for the BANNERTEXT contents of every logon record in :USERS.
Invocation syntax is:
 !BAT.X ['(' options [')'] ]
 
options are any combination of the following, optionally seperated commas.
   T/ABLE for bannertext reports in tabular form.
   J/CL   for bannertext reports in SUPER's jcl format.
   n      Where n is any digit 0 - 9 representing the bannertext
            field to be delivered to the output file.  0 has no
            meaning.
   n-n    Where n is the same as described above.  The - means
            through.  The bannertext from the smaller of the 2
            n's through the larger of the 2 n's is delivered.
   W=x    Where W means width of output page and x is a number between
            1 and 255.  If x is outside that range 255 will be used.
 
If both Table and Jcl are specified, whichever is last is used.  combination.
The output goes through the M$OU DCB to a file called:  USERS_BANNERS.acct, the
acct is the current FMA.
 
The defaults for BAT.X are;
   BAT.X OVER USERS_BANNERS (JCL,1-9,W=255)
 
This tool is for use by a system administrator.  It is first used to report the
BANNERTEXT fields for all logon users.  It's second function is to generate JCL
for SUPER that can be globally edited and run.

Installed in the X account.   Named by Gary A. Roberts.
Two DCBs are used by BAT.  They are:
 1) M$SI -used to read from the :USERS.:SYS file.
 2) M$OU -used to write to the USERS_BANNERS file.
 !BAT.X (T,1
      That creates a table consisting of each logon and it's
      BANNERTEXT1 field.
 !BAT.X (T,1,5
      Same as first example except this gets BANNERTEXT1 and 5.
 !BAT.X (T,1-5,W=80
      Same as first example except this gets BANNERTEXT1 through 5.
      The table will attempt to be written on an 80 column page.
 !BAT.X (T
      Creates a table consisting of each logon and all it's
      BANNERTEXT fields.
 !BAT.X (J
      Creates a file containing input jcl for SUPER which resets
      all the current BANNERTEXT fields back to what they are.
 !BAT.X (J,1-3,5
      Same as just previous except this only creates the JCL for
      BANNERTEXT fields 1, 2, 3 and 5.
 !BAT.X (J135
      Same as just previous except this only creates the JCL for
      BANNERTEXT fields 1, 3 and 5.
Invocation syntax is:
 !BAT.X ['(' options [')'] ]

            1 and 255.  If x is outside that range 255 will be used.
