    STI - Software Technical Identifiers
 
         STI is a processor that can create, modify, verify
              and display the STI record contained in a file
              with the FILE TYPE of:
                   R? - rununit of any type
                   O? _ objectunit of any type
                   S6 - source file using comment fields
                        delimited by "/*" and "*/"
                   ST - source file using comment fields
                        delimited by ".*"
                   IH - help files
                   IX - error message files
                   Dd - CRAWDAD formats
                   TM - TEXT macros
                   LE - LEMUR files
                   WA - APL workspaces
 
    Syntax is:
 
         !STI.X fid [,productfile] [(option[option]...)]
            or
         !STI.X fid (ON|TO|OVER|INTO) oufid
    where:
 
         fid - any legal CP6 fid with leading or trailing wildcarding.
 
         oufid - if specified, STI will create a PRODUCT or TYPE database
              file from fid.  The first non-comment (" in column one)
              record in fid determines which type of file to create or update.
              If the third character is blank, a TYPE file is assumed, and
              should be copied into STI to be useful.  The first two characters
              specify the type being described, and the rest describe it.
              Otherwise, for a PRODUCT file, if the first character is not
              blank, the first 14 characters are the MI, and the next up-to-24
              are the product name for all the filenames that follow in records
              starting with at least one blank.  See STI_TYPE_SIC1 and
              STI_PRODUCT_SIC1 for examples.
 
         productfile - file containing the product names and
              marketing identifiers keyed on fid name.
 
         options - options are enclosed in a set of parentheses.
              If no options other than SUMMARY are used, the STI of fid is
              just displayed.
              If more then one option is specified, options are
              separated by commas:
 
                   C[REATE]
                   S[UMMERY]
                   MA[RKID] = value
                   M[ODIFY]
                   P[RODUCT] = value
                   V[ERSION] = value
                   U[TS]
 
         C[REATE] - create mode see MODIFY create mode.
 
         S[UMMARY] - two line display (MARKID not displayed)
 
         MA[RKID] = value - Marketing Identifier 7 char.
 
 
         M[ODIFY] - can be specified alone or with other options.
 
              1) If only option specified, create mode is assumed using
                 the following defaults:
                   TYPE      DEFAULT
                    R?       VERSION = version contained in rununit.
                             PRODUCT = spaces
 
                             UTS     = rununits birth UTS.
                    O?       VERSION = 'Create'.
                             PRODUCT = spaces
 
                             UTS     = UTS found in objectunit's head record.
 
                    S6       VERSION = 'Create'.
                             PRODUCT = spaces.
                             UTS     = current UTS.
 
                    ST       (same as S6).
 
                   IH        (same as S6).
                   IX        (same as S6).
                   Dd        (same as S6).
                   TM        (same as S6).
                   LE        (same as S6).
                   WA        (same as S6).
 
              2) If specified with other options, the values assigned
                 will be modified in the STI record in the current fid.
                 If no record exist, it will be created and modified.
 
              3) Verify - if MODIFY is not specified and other options
                          are, then the fields in the STI record will
                          be verified using the values of the given options.
 
              4) Display - if no options are specified then the
                           display mode is assumed displaying the
                           current STI record in the given fid.
 
         P[RODUCT] = value - where value is a 12 character fieid
                             identifing the associated fid.
 
         V[ERSION] = value - where value is a 6 character field
                             identifing the associated fid.
                             Value may also equal 'REL' if used with
                             MODIFY commnad, to indicate that the last
                             3 characters of the version field are to
                             be blanked out to to form the release version.
 
         U[TS]  - if specified as option, current UTS is placed in
                  STI record.
    Examples:
         !STI.X PL6..:SYS (M
         ..STIing
         TYPE PRODUCT      VERSION TIME STAMP (BIRTH) NAME
