GOFER - Searches for text string expressions in files.
 
.*B*
 
It is similar to GOPHER.X, but has a slightly different function.
  o fewer options
  o fully command line invoked, no additional input required
  o allows EDIT style string expressions ( & | ~ )
  o allows optional searching for WORDS
  o much quicker
 
To run: !GOFER.X text-expr,wildfid [ON|TO|OVER|INTO fid] [(options)]
 
     "GOFER" reads from M$GOFER, writes information through M$LO and
     diagnostics through M$DO.  STEPCC is set accordingly: 0 = matches
     found, 2 = no matches found, 4 = no files found, 7 = internal error.
 
.*K* EXAMPLES
 
!GOFER.X DCL & (SYMBOL1 | SYMBOL2), fids
 
  will find lines that contain 'DCL' and 'SYMBOL1'
                            or 'DCL' and 'SYMBOL2'
 
!GOFER.X *I*, fids
 
  will find lines that contain the WORD 'I',
    so '   I = expr' will match,
    but 'DCL X UBIN' will not match.
 
!GOFER.X 'string1' | 'string2' | 'string3', fids
 
  gives the function of !GOPHER.X fids
                             * string1
                             * string2
                             * string3
                             *
 
!GOFER.X ~ (DCL | '/*' | '*/'), fids
 
  looks for anything that doesn't contain 'DCL' or '/*' or '*/', acting like a
  filter.
.*K* TEXT_EXPR
 
     A text-expr is an expression consisting of strings that are to be located
     in the search files.  The expression is a boolean expression, consisting
     of ANDs ('&'), ORs ('|'), NEGations ('~'), and precedence ('('-')').
     Strings are text strings, possibly wildcarded, possibly word-delimitted,
     to be located in the search files.
 
.*B*
 
                 { string }
                 { '(' text-expr ')' }
     text-expr = { '~' text-expr }
                 { text-expr '|' text-expr }
                 { text-expr '&' text-expr }
 
     string = component [ '?' component ] ...
 
                         { 'string' }
     component = [ '*' ] { /string/ }                    [ '*' ]
                         { string-without-'?&|~ ,*()' }
 
.*B*
 
       where :
 
         '*' in component specifies that the character before or after the
             string cannot be a symbol character ('#', '$', '0-9', '@',
             '_', 'A-Z', 'a-z')
 
         '?' in string specifies that anything can be between the
             components.
 
.*K* OPTIONS
The options that GOFER recognizes are:
 
NL/INES    ALL
 
For HELP on a specific option, type:
  HELP(GOFER.X) option
.*K* NLINES
Suppresses the printing of file line numbers.
.*K* ALL
Searches through all file types, the default is to skip file types
  'Rx' (run-units), 'Ox' (object files), and 'Wx' (work spaces).
.*K* OWNER
Mike Mulhaupt, CP-6, ACTC technologies
Developed by Mike since GOPHER is too slow, can't search for words,
is too cumbersome to call, and doesn't allow expressions like EDIT does.

.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
12/14/92  #42043  MAMACTC
.*R*
   Set stepcc on exit (0 = ok, 2 = no matches, 4 = no files found,
   7 = internal error).  Redo the code a bit so that it doesn't rely
   on ACTC internal subroutines.  Fix word delimiter mixup.
.*B*
10/23/92  #41954  MAMACTC
.*R*
   Fixed to do wildcarded filenames correctly for post-wildcarding.
   Can do BLOCKed reads - which are useful when doing compressing reads.
     (only if installed in .:SYS)
   Uses XUG for input - allowing continuations on the call.
   Uses the most optimized reads yet - and skips non-matched file names better
   Adds the ALL options. defaults to skipping rununits, object files, and
     workspaces
.*R*
12/04/91
.*R*
Fix blank file name handling.
.*R*
12/02/91
.*R*
Avoid parsing problems from IBEX, allowing use of M$LO

.*R*
Installed in LADC X account.
