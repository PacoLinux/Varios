REV_REC is a tool to "review" records in a file, much as PCL's
REVIEW command will "review" a set of files.
.*B*
Command line syntax:
 
     !REV_REC.X fid
 
Where
 
fid  is a file identifier of a keyed disk file to be reviewed.
.*B*
REV_REC will display a record from the file, then ask you what you
want to do.  The REV_REC commands are:
    Command     Description                             HELP topic
    -------     -----------------------------------     ----------
    OK          Skip this record.                       OK
    (no command) Same as OK command.                    OK
    +n          Skip forward "n" records.               +
    -n or ^     Skip backward "n" records.              - or ^
    'xxx'       Position the file to key "xxx".         KEY
    .nnn        Position the file to key O'nnn'         KEY
    DE/LETE     Delete this record.                     DELETE
    Q/UIT       Quit REV_REC, go back to IBEX.          QUIT
    E/ND        Quit REV_REC, go back to IBEX.          END
.*K* OK
.*B* SYNTAX
Syntax:  O/K
    or:           (no entry on command line; just carraige-return)
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
    Does nothing to this record.  Reads the next sequential record
    in the file.
.*
.*K* '+'
.*B* SYNTAX
Syntax:  +n  or  +
 where:  "n" is a decimal number from 0 to 2**35-1; it defaults to 1.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
    Skip forward "n" records in the file.
.*
.*K* '-' '^'
.*B* SYNTAX
Syntax:  -n  or  -  or  ^
 where:  "n" is a decimal number from 0 to 2**35-1; it defaults to 1.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
    Skip backward "n" records in the file.
.*
.*K* KEY
.*B* SYNTAX
Syntax:  { 'xxxx...' }  [    { 'xxxx...' }      ]
         { .nnnnnn   }  [ ,  { .nnnnnn   }  ... ]
where:
    'xxxx...' is any string of characters enclosed in apostrophes (').
        Apostrophes may be included in the string by doubling them
        (e.g., "'it''s'" evaluates to the string "it's").
    .nnnnnn is a string of octal digits.  Any number of digits may
        be given after the period.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
    Positions the file to the record with key equal to or greater
    than the specified key.
    If more than one character or octal string is entered, separated
    by commas, then the strings are concatenated.  For example,
            'GE',.116105122,'AL',.15
    evaluates to an 8-byte key:  "GENERAL" followed by a carriage
    return.
    Keys may contain a maximum of 255 characters.
.*
.*K* DELETE
.*B* SYNTAX
Syntax:  DE/LETE
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
    Deletes the record displayed just above the command line.
    Before actually deleting the record, REV_REC will require
    confirmation:  it will display:
        Delete record? (Y/N)
    To proceed with the deletion, you must enter "Y" by itself on
    the line.  To cancel the delete command, enter anything else
    on the line.  (Note that entering nothing on the line is
    taken to mean you want to cancel the delete command.)

    REV_REC uses M$SI for the file whose records are to be "reviewed".
    REV_REC always converses via the user's terminal for commands
    and displays (M$UC DCB).
