FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=80)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

E.X is a tool that makes it easier to edit by remembering your source file name
and your default editor for the duration of your logon.
.*B* SYNTAX FORMAT
Invocation syntax:
 
!E.X [fid] [option]
 
fid - any standard CP-6 FID.
 
available options:
 
EDIT - standard editor for the CP-6 system [and is the default editor]
       if an editor is not given at E's initial session.
 
6EDIT - CP-6 screen editor. [As 6EDIT is a separately priced product, it may
not be on your system].
 
Type '?' for description.
.*B*
E will remember the logon user's edit file name so that later invocations of E
without a file name will automatically edit the same file with the same editor.
E.X works this way as long as you are logged on; if you logoff and logon again,
you'll have to respecify your E.X parameters.  The default file can be changed
by invoking E with a new FID.
 
E will link to a specified editor if it is given as an option.  If an editor is
not specified, E will link to EDIT.:SYS by default.
 
If E is invoked when a user first logs on without a FID, an message will appear
specifying that there is no such command variable.  E expects a valid FID to
accompany the command if it is first invoked so it will have a FID to remember.
E will also expect a valid editor at its first invocation so it will have an
editor to remember.  If an editor is not given, E will link to the default
editor EDIT.
.*K* SPECIAL_USES
E.X can easily call alternate, additional editors if your system manager or
other systems programmer has modified it to do so.

Fixed bug that caused E to bomb when the FID (including account and password)
exceeded 31 characters in length.  Also fixed bug in 6EDIT option that didn't
open the desired file.  The 6EDIT option now works correctly.
