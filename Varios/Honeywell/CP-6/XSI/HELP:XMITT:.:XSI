XMITT produces text strings primarily for the purpose of testing communication
lines and links.
XMITT is simple-minded (e.g., it was written without use of X$PARSE), so you
must follow the instructions carefully, and take special note of the order in
which options occur.
 
Full command line syntax:
 
!XMITT.X ON,output ([[dvfc],][[rlen],][cs])
 
If "dvfc" is specified, it overrides the default default VFC character of 'A'.
 
If "rlen" is specified, it overrides the default output record length of 80.
 
If "cs" is specified, it overrides the default character string to be
replicated in the buffer of 'ABCDEFGHIJ'.
 
(Note: "dvfc" must be one non-numeric character, that's how we tell dvfc-only
from rlen-only.  Also, "cs" can have no commas in it.)
Here's some examples:
 
!XMITT.X
   writes 80-character records with 'A' (single-space after print) VFC ..
 ABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJ.....
 
!XMITT.X    (67,)
   writes 67-character records with 'A' (single-space after print) VFC..
 ABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJ.....
  (The longest record that can be written is 2048 bytes long.)
 
!XMITT.X    (,Do as I Say  )
   writes 80-character records with 'A' (single-space after print) VFC..
 Do as I Say  Do as I Say  Do as I Say  .....
 Any characters except ')' are legal.  (Good for HASP compression tests).
 
!XMITT.X    (a,)
 writes 80-character records with 'a' (single-space before print) VFC..
 ABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJABCDEFGHIJ.....
 Any VFC character except 0 - 9, ',', ')' will be accepted.
 
<more>
!XMITT.X    (a,67,Do as I Say  )
 writes 67-character records with 'a' (single-space before print) VFC..
 Do as I Say  Do as I Say  Do as I Say  Do as I Say  Do as I Say  Do
 This shows how to combine options.

To give you a better idea how fast you are going, XMITT sticks a number into
each record:
 Records 0 thru 99 records have number in columns 7-8.
 Records 100 thru 999, in col 6-8.
 Records 1000 thru 9999, in col 5-8.
  etc.  XMITT will quit after 9,999,999 records, if you care to wait so long.
