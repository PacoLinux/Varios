AUTH uses the SUPER routines to list the entries in the specified users
authorization record, in :USERS.
.*B*
Invocation syntax:
 
 !AUTH.X [acct[,uname]]
 
If the acct,uname is not specified, then the current user's account and uname
are used.  If account or account,uname is specified the user must be authorized
for SUPER, SUPERA, or SUPERD pprivs, or FMREAD or FMSEC privileges.  If
account,uname is specified, AUTH will list the authorization for just that
account.  Wildcarding is allowed, if the "uname" is not specified.  If the user
does not have read access to :USERS.:SYS through his privileges, then he can
only display his own authorization, and cannot specify an "account" or an
"account,uname", or a wildcarded account.  If AUTH can't find any account to
match the input on the command line, he will so inform you.
 
AUTH MUST be run either by a logon user with READ access to the :USERS.:SYS
file, or from .X if the :USERS.:SYS file grants AUTH.X read access.
 
.*B*
When AUTH is invoked, he verifies the command on the command line, and makes
suree that the specified account exists in :USERS.  If it does, or if a wild-
carded account was specified, AUTH presents the prompt "OPT*".  At this point,
the user may specify which fields of the authorization record he wants listed,
or ALL, which will cause the entire authorization record to be listed.  A blank
line or END signals that the user is through specifying options (except in the
case of ALL, which is acted on immediately).  AUTH then lists the desired
fields for the specified account, or for each account that matches the
wildcard, if any.  If no options are specified at the "OPT*" prompt, AUTH will
just the "account,uname" and exit, unless a wildcarded account was specified.
If this is the case, AUTH will produce an alphabetical, formatted listing of
each "account,uname" that matches the wildcard.
 
For more information, see the System Support Reference Manual, under User
Authorization.
.*K* INSTALLATION
AUTH MUST be run either by a logon user with READ access to the :USERS.:SYS
file, or from .X if the :USERS.:SYS file grants AUTH.X read access.
.*K* INVOCATION
Invocation syntax:
 
 !AUTH.X [acct[,uname]]

account,uname is specified, AUTH will list the authorization for just that
account.  Wildcarding is allowed, if the "uname" is not specified.  If the user
does not have read access to :USERS.:SYS through his privileges, then he can
