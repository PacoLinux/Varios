    OX (fOrtran Xref) will cross reference a Fortran program and/or
subroutines.  It has been modified to handle (hopefully) most features
of ANS 77 Fortran.

.*K* BC
BC ([bc1[,...bcn]][,bcname1[,...bcnamen]])
.*B*
  where:
    bc? is an integer > 0 indicating the modules relative position within the
        source file.
    bcname?  indicates the name of the routine or module to be cross
             referenced.
.*B*
  The BC option allows you to specify specific module(s) within the source file
  that you want cross referenced.
.*B*
  Example:
    BC(1,3,HEADINGS,EOJ)
      Specifies to cross reference the first and third modules and the modules
      named HEADINGS and EOJ.
.*K* DEFAULTS
.*K* IGNORE IGNORE_ENDS NOENDS NO_ENDS
I/GNORE [E/NDS]
.*B*
  Tells OX to treat the entire file as one module so that all Symbols, Units
  and/or Labels in all modules are listed in one cross reference listing.
.*K* LABELS LINE_NUMBERS STATEMENT_NUMBERS
LA/BELS
.*B*
  Tells OX to cross reference statement labels (statement numbers).
.*K* LS LISTING
L/I[S/TING]
.*B*
  Requests a source listing precede the cross reference listing.
.*K* NLS NO_LISTING
N/O L/I[S/TING]
.*B*
  Requests that the source listing of the program be suppressed.
.*K* NOLABELS NO_LABELS
N/O LA/BELS
.*B*
  Requests that statement labels (statement numbers) NOT be cross referenced.
.*K* NOSYMBOLS NO_SYMBOLS
N/O S/YMBOLS
.*B*
  Requests that Symbols NOT be cross referenced.
.*K* NOUNITS NO_UNITS
N/O U/NITS
.*B*
  Requests that Unit numbers NOT be cross referenced.
.*K* NOX NO_X NOXLINES NO_XLINES 'NOX-LINES' 'NO_X-LINES'
N/O X[[-]L/INES]
.*B*
  Requests that X type conditional compilation statements (i.e. statements
  containing an X in column 1) be treated as comments and therefore NOT cross
  referenced.
.*K* NOY NO_Y NOYLINES NO_YLINES 'NOY-LINES' 'NO_Y-LINES'
N/O Y[[-]L/INES]
.*B*
  Requests that Y type conditional compilation statements (i.e. statements
  containing an Y in column 1) be treated as comments and therefore NOT cross
  referenced.
.*K* NOZ NO_Z NOZLINES NO_ZLINES 'NOZ-LINES' 'NO_Z-LINES'
N/O Z[[-]L/INES]
.*B*
  Requests that Z type conditional compilation statements (i.e. statements
  containing an Z in column 1) be treated as comments and therefore NOT cross
  referenced.
.*K* PUTTOTALS PUT_TOTALS TOTALS
[P/UT] T/OTALS
.*B*
  Include a summary of how many Labels, Symbols and/or Units were referenced in
  the file and how many times each were referenced.  Also, a count of how many
  comment lines were encountered is printed.
.*B*
  Example, if the invocation command was:
    !OX.X FEEP_SI02.:CONVERT ON ,NO(PUT TOTALS
  output might be something like:
    File FEEP_SI02.:CONVERT contains 368 source lines (247 (67%) are comments),
        14 Labels which are referenced a total of 30 times
        51 Symbols which are referenced a total of 157 times
    ------
        65 items which are referenced a total of 187 times
 
         7 Subroutine(s), Function(s) and/or Main(s)
.*K* SELECT CHOOSE ONLY FIND
S/ELECT (xx1,...xx99)
.*B*
  Tells OX to only cross reference the selected items.  The items (xx?) may be
  statement labels, symbols and/or unit numbers specified in any order.  In
  order to distinguish unit numbers from statement labels, unit numbers must
  be preceded by 'F$'.
.*B*
  Example:
    !OX.X FEEP_SI02.:CONVERT(SELECT(100,B)
      100           273.000    277.000*

  found in each compile module and how many times each was referenced.

.*K* CHANGES Changes changes
10/08/84
.*R*
    Added code to: NOT cross reference logical operators (OR, NOT, etc.) as
    per STAR 20403; improved the selection of what to cross reference in I/O
    statements (STARs 20027, 20480 and 21505).
.*B*
06/03/84
.*R*
    Added code to: handle up to 31 character names as per STAR 16953, detect
    statement labels correct (STAR 18242), fix the BC option (STAR 18248),
    and fix the handling of DOUBLE PRECISION statements (STAR 20197).
.*R*
10/28/83
.*R*
    Taught OX about the 'nnnnnS' and '*nnnnn' constructs of statement label
    in CALL statements (STAR 18242).
.*R*
10/09/82
    1) Taught OX to handle ELSEIF statements better (STAR 14417)
 
    2) Taught OX to handle input from a DEVICE (STAR 12877)
.*R*
09/30/82
    1) Taught OX to handle non-EDIT keyed source files better. (STAR 14169)
 
    2) Taught OX not count and list the same line twice when a comment
       line follows a PROGRAM, SUBROUTINE and/or FUNCTION statement and
       that comment line had something besides a blank or zero in column 6.
       For more information see STAR 14170.
 
    3) Taught OX distinguish between READ and WRITE statements with imbedded
       formats (i.e. FMT='(1X,I5)') and a direct access flavored statement
       (eg. READ(111'I,999)).  Before, OX was assuming that when it found
       a single quote after a left parenthesis of a READ or WRITE statement
       that it was a quote in a direct access reference.  But when the quote
       was that in a FMT, OX proceded to XREF the stuff in the FMT!
       For more information, see STAR 14271.
 
    4) Taught OX not to skip the second record if the first record was all
       blank.  See STAR 14272 for more information.
 
    5) Taught OX to process the PARAMETER statement correctly. (STAR 14273)
