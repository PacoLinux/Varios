.*K* CONCEPTS
Front-end programs (fprgs) are programs written to be run in the fep.  With
MUPPET, fprgs may be started, monitored to completion or stopped prematurely.
In order to keep track of all the fprgs, MUPPET uses an internal table indexed
by slot.  All the information about an fprg is kept in this table, so a
particular fprg is said to occupy a slot in the table.  This slot is assigned
by MUPPET sequentially starting at one, or can be explicitly specified using
the SLOT option on the OPEN command.
.*B*
Fprgs started with MUPPET may send data to the host or request data from the
host.  The fprg does this via M$READs/M$WRITEs through the M$LM dcb in the
fprg.  MUPPET will answer the request of data by sending a record from a file
specified on the READ command or the READ option of the OPEN command.
Likewise, data sent to MUPPET from the fprg will be written to a file specified
on the WRITE command or the WRITE option of the OPEN command.  If an fprg
attempts to do any i/o with the host, but a corresponding READ or WRITE command
has not been given (or specified as an option on the OPEN command), the fprg
will be suspended until a READ or WRITE command is given for the suspended
fprg.  Note that HANDLER mode fprgs, as well as fprgs that specify the
IGNORE option, may not do I/O with the host in this manner.

.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
.*R*
fprg_fid    specifies the fep run-unit to put into execution.
 
options     specifies one or more options separated by commas or
            spaces.  Type !HELP (MUPPET.X) OPTIONS for a list of
            valid options.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
.*R*
The OPEN command starts an fprg.  The fep, mode, internal slot, and any files
the fprg is to use may be specified in the options for this command.  Any files
that the fprg will use are opened and prepared for use by the fprg.
.*K* OPTIONS OPEN_OPTIONS
To display all options, type ??.  To display a specific option, type:
 
HELP (MUPPET.X) OPTIONS option
 
  Valid option names are FEP, MODE, SLOT, READ, WRITE, and IGNORE.
.*B* FEP
FE/P [{=|IS}] n
            Specifies the fep that this fprg is to run in.  If fep is not
            specified, the default fep is taken from B$JIT.TSLINE.FEX in
            time-sharing mode, or an error is reported in batch or ghost
            mode.
.*B* MODE
MO/DE [{=|IS}] {G/HOST|U/SER|H/ANDLER|C/OMGROUP}
            Specifies the mode that this fprg is to run in.  If mode is
            not specified, the default is GHOST.  USER mode fprgs may
            only be started by time-sharing jobs in B$JIT.TSLINE.FEX.
.*B* SLOT
SL/OT [{=|IS}] n
            Specifies which slot this fprg is to occupy.  If slot is not
            specified, MUPPET will place the fprg in the first available
            slot.  Note that this slot number is used to refer to this
            fprg in subsequent commands.
.*B* READ RD INFILE
{RE/AD|RD|IN/FILE} [{=|IS}] fid
            Specifies which file MUPPET is to read records in order to
            satisfy any read requests by the fprg.  If this option is
            not given, and the fprg issues a read, the fprg will be
            suspended until a READ command is given for that fprg.
.*B* WRITE OUTFILE
{WR/ITE|OUT/FILE} [{=|IS}] fid
            Specifies the file MUPPET is to write any records sent by
            the fprg.  If this option is not given and the fprg issues
            issues a write, the fprg will be suspended until a WRITE
            command is given for that fprg.
.*B* IGNORE KYFPOTF
IGNORE
            Specifies that MUPPET is not to interfere at all with this
            fprg.  Note that this means that MUPPET will not be informed
            that this fprg has exited, and therefore the slot that this
            fprg occupies will be in use for the remainder of the MUPPET
            session.  Since MUPPET will not communicate in any way with
            an frpg opened with this option, I/O with MUPPET is impossible.
            Such an fprg will not have an entry made in MUPPET's internal
            tables, and therefore will not be know to the LIST command.
            HANDLER mode fprgs will automatically have this option specified
            for them.
.*K* CLOSE
Syntax:
.*R*
CL/OSE [SL/OT] slot
.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
.*R*
slot        specifies the internal slot number to close
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
.*R*
The CLOSE command stops an fprg.  Any files the fprg may have been using as
well as the dcb for the fprg itself are closed.  The internal slot the fprg was
using is also prepared for re-use.
.*K* READ
Syntax:
.*R*
RE/AD [SL/OT] slot [FR/OM] in_file
.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
.*R*
slot        specifies which fprg this read is to affect.
 
in_file     specifies the file from which records are to
            be read to satisfy reads from this fprg.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
.*R*
The READ command specifies the file used to satisfy reads from an fprg.  Each
time the fprg issues a read, it will be satisfied by MUPPET with the next
sequential record from the file.
.*K* WRITE
Syntax:
.*R*
WR/ITE [SL/OT] slot {TO|ON|OVER|INTO} out_file
.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
.*R*
slot        specifies which fprg this write is to affect.
 
out_file    specifies where records from this fprg are to
            be written.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
.*R*
The WRITE command specifies where records sent to MUPPET by the fprg are to be
written.  Upon termination of the fprg, MUPPET will close the file with
DISP=SAVE so that the file may be examined.
.*K* LIST
Syntax:
.*R*
L/IST [[SL/OT] slot]
.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
.*R*
slot        specifies which fprg to list.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
.*R*
The LIST command lists information about the currently running fprgs.  This
information includes slot number, fep, mode, running clock time, and all
associated files and record counts.  If a slot is not specified, all currently
running fprgs will be listed.
.*K* WAIT
Syntax:
.*R*
WA/IT [[SL/OT] slot]
.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
.*R*
slot        specifies the fprg for which to wait.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
.*R*
The WAIT command tells MUPPET not to prompt for more commands until the
specified fprg stops.  If no slot is given, MUPPET will wait until all fprgs
are stopped.  This command is useful if MUPPET is running as a ghost and simply
need to manage the fprg's i/o until the fprg stops, or if MUPPET should wait
until an fprg has stopped by itself before continuing with the next command.
This should be used before and END command to insure that MUPPET does not stomp
on any fprgs before exiting.
.*K* PROMPT
Syntax:
.*R*
PRO/MPT string
.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
.*R*
string      specifies the desired prompt character string, from 1 to 31
            characters.  If any non-alphanumeric characters are used, the
            entire string must be enclosed in quotes.
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
.*R*
This command allows the user to change MUPPET's prompt string to
another character string.
.*K* END QUIT EXIT XIT
Syntax:
.*R*
{E/ND|Q/UIT|[E]X/IT}
.*B* PARAMETERS
Parameters:
.*R*
NONE
.*B* DESCRIPTION
Description:
.*R*
The END command stops any currently running fprgs, closes any files that may
have been in use, and exits MUPPET.
.*K* KNOWN_PROBLEMS KNOWN_BUGS BUGS
o     There is a quirk in the fep/host interface that causes the
      event reporting the fprg has stopped to be reported before
      the event reporting that the fprg has satisfied a read put
      on it by the host.  This only happens when the fprg writes
      its last record to the host and then promptly stops.  This
      problem, however, has an easy work-around.  Simply issue a
      one or two second wait in the fprg, after writing the last
      record back to the host, or before exiting.
 
o     There seems to be a problem with fprgs doing both input and
      output to the host via MUPPET.  This is only if MUPPET is
      handling both input and output.  If, for example, MUPPET
      supplies records to a User fprg, and the fprg writes these
      out through M$UC, everything works fine.
 
o     There are no no-wait writes to fprgs.  The ramifications of
      this with regard to the READ command are obvious.
 
o     Please report any other problems or comments concerning
      MUPPET to Dave Wagner at LADC. (ext. 245, room 244)
.*K* ERRORS
MUPPET has the capability to inform the fprg of errors encountered while
accessing files for the fprg.  Currently the only type of error that MUPPET
will handle is an error when trying to read a record from an input file.  If
this happens, MUPPET will send an eight byte buffer to the fprg.  The first
four bytes of the buffer contain the characters 'ERR:', and the last four bytes
are a standard thirty-two bit LCP6 error code.  The fprg may, for example,
examine the returned buffer after each read to determine if end-of-file or some
other error was encountered on the read.
 
MUPPET can also detect some errors within the fprg.  To do this, the fprg must
be LINKed with MUPPET_XCON.X.
