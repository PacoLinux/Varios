WSN is a tool that will change a user's B$JIT.WOO.
Command line syntax:
     !WSN workstation_name
 
where
     workstation_name is a 1-8 character identifier of an existing workstation.
WSN must be run from :SYS only, as it requires FMR and JIT privileges to work
correctly.  WSN uses JIT privilege to change B$JIT.WOO.  WSN uses FMR privilege
to check to see if the workstation_name specified is in the :WSN.:SYS file.
WSN also checks the user's current LDEV definitions and will reissue the LDEV's
for LP01 and CP01 automatically, changing them to the new workstation (this
action causes an automatic !PRINT function for those streams affected).  OTHER
LDEV STREAMS ARE NOT CHANGED.  Note that WSN only changes the user's JIT
workstation.  The user table in the monitor also contains a WSN that is used
for SENDALL and X'ing purposes (it's linked to the console's PADMIN attribute
and WSN).  The monitor's WSN entry doesn't get changed by WSN.
 
WSN writes its error messages through M$DO.
