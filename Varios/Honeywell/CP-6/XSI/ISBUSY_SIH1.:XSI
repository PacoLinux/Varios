FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
ISBUSY can be used in a command stream to test a file's ability to be used
exclusively, and conditionally continue with the jobstream accordingly.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!ISBUSY.X disk_file
 
where:
 
 disk_file is a diskfile fid that is to be tested.
 
STEPCC is set to 1 if ANY M$OPEN error occurs.  You can use the IBEX $FID_EXIST
function if existence of the file is in question.
