MINNOW (Make INdexed file NOW) reads an existing file and creates an alternate
keyed Indexed file using index information (starting position, length, etc.)
supplied at run time.  At the time the CREATE command is issued, options
controlling the LOAD, ALTBLD, CTG, IXTNSIZE, RELGRANS and/or XTNSIZE may be
specified.

.*K* COPY
CO[py] srce_fid {ON|TO|OVER} dest_fid [,copy_option[,copy_option]...]
     where "copy_option" is one of the following:
       AL[TBLD] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
       CTG [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
       IX[TNSIZE] = dec
       L[OAD] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
       RE[LGRANS] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
       XT[NSIZE] = dec
 
This command causes the actual creation  of the new file using the options (if
any)  specified.  At least  one INDEX command  must have been  issued prior to
this command.  If the COPY is successfully executed, MINNOW will automatically
exit as if an END command had been issued.
.*B* ALTBLD
AL[TBLD] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
    ALTBLD  = YES specifies  that the alternate  indices for this indexed file
    are to be rebuilt.  ALTBLD =  NO specifies that they are not.  The default
    is to rebuild them only if necessary.
.*B* CTG
CTG [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
    CTG  controls cataloging of  the file at  OPEN time.  CTG  = YES specifies
    that the file is to be cataloged  in the file directory at OPEN time.  Any
    existing file of the same name  is deleted from the file directory.  CTG =
    NO specifies  that the file is  not to be cataloged  at OPEN time.  If the
    file creation is terminated by an unexpected error, normally no file would
    be created at all.  If CTG = YES was specified, any records written to the
    new  file  prior  to  the  occurrance  of  the  unexpected  error, will be
    retained.  However, depending on other  options specified, they may or may
    not have their alternate indexes built.
.*B* IXTNSIZE
IX[TNSIZE] = dec
    IXTNSIZE specifies the initial extent size for the file.
.*B* LOAD
L[OAD] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
    LOAD = YES, the default, specifies that when records are written, keys are
    to be entered into the primary  index only - the alternate indices will be
    built or rebuilt at a later time.  LOAD = NO, indicates that the alternate
    indices will  be built as each  record is written.  The  LOAD = NO mode is
    SIGNIFICANTLY slower and should be avoided in almost all cases.
.*B* RELGRANS
RELGRANS [{ = NO | = YES}]
    This indicates whether (YES) excess  granules in the last extent should be
    released or not when the file gets CLOSEd.  Default is YES.
.*B* XTNSIZE
XTNSIZE = dec
    Indicates the size, in granules, of secondary extents.  Default is 2.
.*K* CREATE
CR[EATE] dest_fid F[ROM] srce_fid [,create_option[,create_option]...]
     where "create_option" is one of the following:
       AL[TBLD] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
       CTG [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
       IX[TNSIZE] = dec
       L[OAD] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
       RE[LGRANS] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
       XT[NSIZE] = dec
 
This command causes the actual creation  of the new file using the options (if
any)  specified.  At least  one INDEX command  must have been  issued prior to
this command.  If the CREATE is successfully executed, MINNOW will
automatically exit as if an END command had been issued.
.*B* ALTBLD
AL[TBLD] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
    ALTBLD  = YES specifies  that the alternate  indices for this indexed file
    are to be rebuilt.  ALTBLD =  NO specifies that they are not.  The default
    is to rebuild them only if necessary.
.*B* CTG
CTG [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
    CTG  controls cataloging of  the file at  OPEN time.  CTG  = YES specifies
    that the file is to be cataloged  in the file directory at OPEN time.  Any
    existing file of the same name  is deleted from the file directory.  CTG =
    NO specifies  that the file is  not to be cataloged  at OPEN time.  If the
    file creation is terminated by an unexpected error, normally no file would
    be created at all.  If CTG = YES was specified, any records written to the
    new  file  prior  to  the  occurrance  of  the  unexpected  error, will be
    retained.  However, depending on other  options specified, they may or may
    not have their alternate indexes built.
.*B* IXTNSIZE
IX[TNSIZE] = dec
    IXTNSIZE specifies the initial extent size for the file.
.*B* LOAD
L[OAD] [{ = N[O] | = Y[ES] }]
    LOAD = YES, the default, specifies that when records are written, keys are
    to be entered into the primary  index only - the alternate indices will be
    built or rebuilt at a later time.  LOAD = NO, indicates that the alternate
    indices will  be built as each  record is written.  The  LOAD = NO mode is
    SIGNIFICANTLY slower and should be avoided in almost all cases.
.*B* RELGRANS
RELGRANS [{ = NO | = YES}]
    This indicates whether (YES) excess  granules in the last extent should be
    released or not when the file gets CLOSEd.  Default is YES.
.*B* XTNSIZE
XTNSIZE = dec
    Indicates the size, in granules, of secondary extents.  Default is 2.
.*K* DISPLAY
DI[SPLAY] fid
    Displays the alternate keys of an existing file.
.*K* END EXIT XIT QUIT
{ E[ND] | EX[IT] | X[IT] | Q[UIT] }
    Exits MINNOW.
.*K* HELP
H/ELP [(processor)][ TOPICS ][ keyword1 ][ - ][ keyword2]
 where:
processor - specifies a program or processor that has an associated HELP file.
            The default is the processor currently under control (in this case,
            LEECH).
 
TOPICS    - specifies that only a list of available topics (message names) is
            required.  The range of topics is determined by keyword1 or
            keyword2.
 
keyword1  - specifies the name of the message to be printed.
 
keyword2  - if a range is specified (by including a dash " - " or greater
            than ">"), keyword2 is the upper limit of the range.  If a range is
            not specified, keyword2 is a submessage, or category within a
            message.
.*B*
HELP prints information.
 
HELP messages have levels.  Once the initial level has been printed, typing a
question mark prints the next level, usually containing greater detail.
Typing two question marks prints the entire message.
 
Any processor with a standard HELP file can be read from LEECH.
 
The HELP can be issued at the double-bang (!!) without losing the suspended
activity.  Thus, one may exit a processor (such as FORTRAN) with a <CNTL><Y>,
query for HELP information, and then issue GO to return to FORTRAN.
L/IST [I/NDEX] [ (indx#[...,indx#] | A/LL) ]
    Lists information about the specified index(es).  Information such as the
    index number, indexes starting position in the record (based from zero),
    index length (in bytes) and an indication of whether duplicate keys are
    allowed for that index.
.*K* INFORM
INF[ORM] [,] ON O[PERATORS] C[ONSOLE] [,] [E[VERY]] nrecs [R[ECORDS]]
    The  INFORM  command  causes  MINNOW  to  display  a message every "nrecs"
    indicating  what record  it is  processing.  If  the ON  OPERATORS CONSOLE
    phrase is present, the message is also displayed on the operators console.
.*K* INDEX
[I[NDEX]] index_num , [,index_option[,index_option]...]
     where "index_option" is one of the following:
       D[UPLICATES]
       E[ND] = end_pos
       L[ENGTH] = length
       S[TART] = start_pos
 
This command allows the user to specify a keys position within a record,
how long it is (or its ending position) and whether duplicates are allowed or
not.  Note that the END and LENGTH options are mutually exclusive; that is, one
or the other may be specified but not both.  If both are specified, the last
one will be used.
.*B* DUPLICATES DUPES
D[UPLICATES]
    If specified indicates that duplicates are allowed for the index.  If this
    option is not specified, no duplicates will be allowed for the index.
.*B* END
E[ND] = dec
    The END option specifies the ending position (zero based) of the index and
    must be greater than or equal to the START value.
.*B* LENGTH
L[ENGTH] = length
    The LENGTH  option specifies the index length,  in bytes.  It is sometimes
    more  convienent to specify  a START position  and a LENGTH  rather than a
    START and an  END position.  If this option is  specified, the START value
    plus the LENGTH value must be less than the record length.
.*B* START
S[TART] = start_pos
    The START option specifies the first position (zero based) that this index
    will occupy.  The value must be  between zero and one less that the record
    length.
.*K* MODIFY
MOD[IFY] .fid
    Modify the alternate indexes of an existing file. Note that index  1
    cannot be changed and the maximum length of the alternate key structure
    cannot be increased.
.*K* NUMBER_OF_KEYS
N[UMBER] [O[F]] [I[NDEXES]] = dec
    Indicates the number of indexes the file will have.
.*K* RECSIZE
R[ECSIZE] = dec
    Indicates the maximum record length of any record in the file.
