FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X
(LEN=79) prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee
that the lines of text in it will fill a screen as much as possible,
and that more lines will end up per screen.

.*A*
FCG_DATA (Functional Code Group _DATA file) is a data base file that
FCG.X opens by default.  This is a seperately maintained "tool".
.*B*
There is no command line syntax for this "tool".  For further details
see !HELP (FCG.X).
 
.*K* UPKEEP
The messages in the FCG_DATA file are entered and kept up to date in
a manual fashion.  Messages may be added or modified by a simple
"plus-packet" in the usual X account update procedures.
 
.*B*
The file has a simple structure to it, as follows:
 
fcg backwards_link control_acct"message"
 
  where:
   fcg            is a FCG of the form XYZ
   backwards_link is a "processor" name or area of code
   control_acct   is the CP-6 Control account where the source lives
                  (this field is not presently used, but must exist)
   message        is the data output back to the user
 
.*B*
An fcg would be of the form:
   A__ $BOGUS$ $NOACCT$ Authorization and Accounting
   AS_ SUPER   :E02SI   SUPER - device and form...
   ASA $BOGUS$ $NOACCT$ The "A" module level description of SUPER here
    o
    o
    o
   ASZ $BOGUS$ $NOACCT$ The "Z" module level description of SUPER here
 
   B__ ... etc
 
The "_" (under score) in the fcg is a control character, that tell us
what level of message this is to be.
 
The "$BOGUS$" keyword is used to say that we do not have a backwards link
for this particular message.  The links tend to go with the XY_ type fcgs,
so the $BOGUS$ would be used on all others.
 
The "$NOACCT$" keyword tells us that we do not need an account for this
level of message.  Similar to the BOGUS keyword, this account is usually
only specified for the XY_ level of fcg.
 
.*K* DATA_FILE
FCG.X depends on having a data file to operate properly.
 
FCG_DATA.X is the default, and must be maintained as a seperate X
account "tool".  It has its own help file and everything.
 
   !HELP (FCG.X)  for further info
 
.*K* FYI
FCG_DATA is based on AF71 (AF_0071J-3 when this version was
completed).  Thus, FCG should have it's data file, FCG_DATA.X,
modified when this Arch File is changed in any way.
