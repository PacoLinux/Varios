TIGRCUB is used to test and verify TIGR decks.
Full command line syntax:
 
!TIGRCUB.X tigr_file[,default_file] [ON|OVER|INTO ls_file]
 
where:
 
tigr_file is a file containing the TIGR deck to be tested
 
default_file is a file containing TIGRCUB-specific directives used to establish
certain configuration defaults
 
ls_file is the M$LO output of the TIGRCUB run.
TIGRCUB uses the TIGR modules from the CP-6 monitor to parse TIGR decks.  It
also constructs actual TIGR data in memory, and reports on the number of pages
used for constructing those tables.  TIGR data cannot exceed 128 pages in size.
 
TIGRCUB has been constructed using baling wire, thumbtacks, and paste.  Not
Elmer's Glue-All.  Paste.  You know, the kind Albert Hufnagle would eat in the
second grade just to gross out the girls.  As a result, it does not have an
elegant user interface.  It also uses memory cheaply.  You'll have to !ORES at
least MEM=400 in order to run TIGRCUB.  Maybe more.
TIGRCUB's M$UI fid is used to establish the system "defaults" which would
normally be established by AARDVARK.  If you do not use a "default" file, the
defaults that TIGRCUB uses are:
 
 CONSOLE CHAN=30
 SYSDISK PATH=0-8-1 (451)    "note that the 0 IOM # will be substituted with
                             "the BOOT IOM PORT #, and is ignored"
          (451, 501, 3380, 3381, 3390, 3391, 8082, 8092 are legal DPs)
 SYSLP CHAN=0-24            "see note on ports under SYSDISK
 SYSCR CHAN=0-26            "          "               "
 CPU PORT#=7
 SYSURC PATH=0-24
 SYSTAPE PATH=0-16-1        "see note on ports under SYSDP "
 DISK FIRM = D600
 TAPE FIRM = T610
 URC FIRM = UCMN
 FEP CHAN=0-33              "see note on ports under SYSDISK
 HARDWARE = DPS8
          (DPS8, DPS90, and DPS8000 are the only legal names)
 BOOT IOM PORT# = 0         "note this is a physical port number"
 PHYSICAL MEMORY = 4096     "pages"
 DISPLAY = DCT              "does an ANLZ type display of DCT's
          (DCT, DQH, and MON/ITOR are the only legal displays)
 
The syntax of these commands is what TIGRCUB accepts to establish defaults.
You need not specify all of the defaults; only specify what is different or
changed from the above list.
 
Note that if TIGRCUB says 'cannot find system disk in DCT table' or 'cannot
find system console in DCT table' you probably need a BOOT IOM entry in your
default file.
 
If you don't want to keep your TIGRCUB defaults in a separate file, you can put
them directly in your TIGR deck by using a special commentary syntax:
 
"*TC*  default command
 
NOTES:
 
1) the "*TC* must start in column 1 and must be followed by a single space.
 
2) (of course) the only way this works is if your *TC* lines come BEFORE the
real TIGR deck.
 
3) if a UI file is specified, and contains valid TIGRCUB commands, the embedded
TIGRCUB default records are ignored.

910214 40701 JLJ
Fixed inability to detect malformed !TIGR line.
881026 JTB 890322 JTB 890712 JTB
Added support for MDS I & MDS II disks in TIGRCUB for E02.
Added support for MSU3390 (J)/MSU3391 (K) FIPS disks in TIGRCUB.
Added a dummy module to make the new B$ANDERSON overlay, that was put into
TIGR, possible in TIGRCUB.
880822 JTB  880919 JTB
Allow for IOM number on SYSLP, SYSCR, and FEP commands ( I-Chan ).
Added 3380 and 3381 FIPS disks to SYSDISK option, and accept 4 digit value in
the option list. (nnnn)
Added ANLZ type display capability for DCT's, DQH's, and MONitor information.
Added DISPLAY = DCT, or DQH, or MON command for default files to accomplish
this.
880801 JLJ  880803 JLJ
Added PHYSMEM command for default files.
Made changes to accommodate memory management changes in PE0H.
Added the ability to plant TIGRCUB default commands in TIGR decks by using the
*TC* convention.
880601  JLJ
Added the BOOT IOM command so that AARDVARK's mysterious behavior would be more
accurately duplicated.
880422
Modified TIGRCUB nodes so that default SYSLP, SYSCR, and FEP would accept 3
digit channel numbers.
871111
Put in the HW_TYPE setting from the default file.  This enables you to check
TIGR decks for different machines.  E.g.  DPS8000s can have channel numbers >
63.
