  ETAD - DATE spelled backwards, a processor to edit the :DATE files
     used with the WORKDAY options in DATE.X.
 
  There are three (3) modes in ETAD, Adding dates, Deleting dates, and
     Displaying dates.
 
     (1) Adding: mm/dd/yy = (O/FF,W/ORK) [comment]
                 dayofweek = (O/FF,W/ORK)
     (2) Deleting: (DEL/ETE|REM/OVE) (=|.B) mm/dd/yy
                    dayofweek = N/ONE
     (3) Displaying: DI/SPLAY [ME]  "Displays user's :DATE file."
                     DI/SLPAY SYS   "Displays Sites Default :DATE file."
 
        Where:
           mm/dd/yy - is a date
              mm - two digit month.
              dd - two digit day of month.
              yy - two digit year.
           comment - is a 30 character comment field.
           dayofweek - any day of the week.

.*K* ADD
 
  There are two types of records you can add to :DATE:
 1.  mm/dd/yy = (W/ORK,O/FF) [comment]
     a. If this type of date is entered and the option "WORK"
        was specified then, this would tell DATE.X that this
        day is to be a work day and not to look and the Site's
        record for this day.
 
     b. If this type of date is entered and the option "OFF"
        was specified then, this would tell DATE.X that this
        day is to be a day off and not to look at the Site's
        record for this day.
 
  2. dayofweek = (W/ORK|O/FF|N/ONE)
     a. If this type of day is entered and the option "WORK"
        was specified then, this would tell DATE.X that this
        day of the week is to be a work day and not to look
        at the Site's record of this day of the week.
 
     b. If this type of day is entered and the option "OFF"
        was specified then, this would tell DATE.X that this
        day of the week is to be a day off and not to look
        at the Site's record of this day of the week.
 
     c. If this type of day is entered and the option "NONE"
        was specified then, this would tell DATE.X that this
        day of the week should be based on what is in the
        Site's record for this day. Displayed as a blank ' '.
