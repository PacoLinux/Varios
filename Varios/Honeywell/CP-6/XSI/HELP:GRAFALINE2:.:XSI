GRAFALINE2 creates a one-page line chart of user-supplied data that must be
ennumerated along the X-axis (similar to GRAFASTEP).
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRAFALINE2.X [input_file] OVER graphics_file[,listing_file][(options)]
 
(at the moment, there are several incarnations of GRAFALINE2 in .X; GRAFALINE2
(for the laserprinter), GRAFALINE2DEC (for the DECVT125 and DECVT241),
GRAFALINE2TEK (for 4010-compatibles) and GRAFALINE2DMP (for the HIDMP29).  Use
the version that matches the device you are using.)
 
where:
 
input_file     is a file of GRAFALINE2 input in the format described below.
[Default is to prompt for data from the terminal.] DCB is F$105.
 
graphics_file  is the place you want the graphics to go; it must be specified.
DCB is GRAPHICS00.
 
listing_file   is the place you want the GRAFALINE2 "LO" to go to.  If you're
reading an input_file from a file, you probably want to say NO for this.  DCB
is F$108.
 
options are:
               BORDER - to create a 5% border around your chart.
               FRAME  - to draw a "frame" around the active plotting area.
 
input_data is prompted for, but always in the same order:
 
 Title of chart (80 CHARS.)
 Horizontal axis title (40 char max,[,GRID])
 Vertical axis title (40 char max,[,GRID])
 Notation text for lower-right-hand corner (40 chars.)
 Number of lines to be charted(1-4),Regression(Y/N),Auto or Zero Scaling(A/Z)
 How many intervals to plot (up to 200)
 
At this point, data for each "line" is accepted, each followed by a !EOD record
in XEQ files or files or, separated by pressing the ESCAPE key, then the F key
in an interactive timesharing session.
 
 What is the "name" of line #n (12 char max, [,NOLINE])
 
The first data item for each line is a 12-character (max) title for the line.
Following the title comes interval data.  The "interval data" is an integer and
an interval title separated by spaces:
 
 144  CORN
 155  PEAS
 199  TUNA
 
If the "integer" is -1, that means there is no data for that interval, and no
line should be printed.  This is handy if, for example, you wish to make a
year's worth of chart, but only show 6 month's worth of data.
 
THE INTERVAL TITLES MUST BE SPECIFIED AND MUST BE UNIQUE.  Overlapping
intervals are not allowed; therefore, interval data of all spaces in multiple
intervals is not allowed.
 
The intervals are plotted from left to right in the order received for the
first line.  The program double-checks to make sure that data for subsequent
lines have the same interval titles and that the data for all intervals is
specified for each line.  If you don't want to count up the number of intervals
by hand, specify a "0" for the Number of intervals.  The number of intervals is
assumed to be the same as the number of data points specified for the first
line.
 
A linear regression line is computed and displayed if requested.  This is not
guaranteed to be accurate if the data set has missing data (i.e. -1 values).
Also, linear regression is only computed for a single data set.
Line titles are optional.  If you specify only spaces for line titles the lines
are drawn without any distinguishing features.  If you specify the text string
"DUMMY LABEL" for a line title, the data for that line is only used to "scale
the plot".  That can be useful if you want a series of plots, but the data
varies widely.  DUMMY LABEL data can be the same in all of the plots to force
the plots to have the same large Y-axis.  If the text of the title is anything
else, the title is printed under the main chart title along with a character
that identifies the data line it corresponds to.  The data line is displayed
with embedded characters matching the character next to the title.
If an axis title has the specific string ",GRID" (no spaces) appended to it, a
light, dashed line background grid will be drawn for that axis' values.
 
If a line's title has the specific string ",NOLINE" (no spaces) appended to it,
the data for that line will be scatterplotted (i.e., no connecting lines).  Why
you would want to do this is beyond me.
 
The default is to 'zero scale', meaning that the Y axis will be zero-based.  If
you want Auto-scaling, the Y axis will be autoscaled to the range of the input
data.
GRAFALINE2 uses the CP-6 DIGS graphics system, which is a separately priced
product.  If you don't have it, maybe you should!  It's not that expensive.
