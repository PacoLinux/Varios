WHOM displays certain information about active users in a dynamic fashion for a
user with SPCLMM privilege.
.*B*
Invocation syntax:
 
 !WHOM.X [(] [option,option,...  [)]]
 
Valid options are:
 
ACCT=accn, NAME=uname, FEP=n, INTERVAL=nseconds, SYSID=sysid, USER=.usr,
MEMORY, QUIT, END, XIT, ROLL, LASTBATCH, COUNT=iterations, $, PARTITION, B, O,
G, T
 
Certain options cannot be used with other options; see

!HELP (WHOM.X) COMPATIBLE_OPTIONS

for more info.
 
Type E,Q, or X to exit WHOM.
 
Type a ? for more.
.*B*
WHOM has two types of display and two modes: single user display, multiple user
display, screen update mode, and scroll mode.  The multiple user display
provides the account number, time used, mode, memory size, state and current
program name (blank if at job step) for all selected users.  The single user
display provides much more information (such as privileges and remaining disk
space) for a single selected user.  Both displays provide a breakdown of the
number of users and memory usage.  The screen update mode continuously updates
the information with time delay between updates.  The scroll mode provides the
same information, but the output is scrolled.
.*B*
WHOM runs on most terminals as well as in a batch job.  If the terminal is not
appropriate, or the mode is batch, the output is automatically scrolled and
WHOM will exit after one display.  When in the multiple user display, the
output is scrolled if the number of users being monitored exceeds 39.  WHOM
returns automatically to screen update mode when user level is low enough to
permit it.
 
WHOM exits under the following conditions:
 
 o the user being monitored is no longer there
.*R*
 o the user running WHOM types E,Q, or X in upper or lower case.
.*R*
 o the user running WHOM hits BREAK
.*R*
 o the invocation of WHOM includes the MEMORY,QUIT,END, or XIT option
.*R*
 o the terminal is a TTY type and INTERVAL,COUNT or ROLL was not specified at
   invocation
.*R*
 o the invoking mode is not online and INTERVAL,COUNT or ROLL was not specified
   at invocation
 
Type !HELP (WHOM.X) TOPICS    for topicnames.

.*K* SYNTAX OPTIONS INVOKING
Command line syntax:
 !WHOM.X [(] [option,option,...  [)]]
 
Valid options are:
 
ACCT=accn, NAME=uname, FEP=n, INTERVAL=nseconds, SYSID=sysid, USER=.usr,
MEMORY, QUIT, END, XIT, ROLL, LASTBATCH, COUNT=iterations, $, PARTITION, B, O,
G, T
 
 
Option compatibility rules:
 
The MEMORY option ALWAYS overides all other options except exit.
.*R*
The ACCT or NAME options overide LASTBATCH, SYSID and USER.
.*R*
END,QUIT,XIT ALWAYS overide INTERVAL and COUNT.
.*R*
The last LASTBATCH,SYSID or USER option in an invocation overides any other
LASTBATCH,SYSID or USER.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS means that these options are meaningful when used with the
specified option, otherwise the most significant options are used.
 
To see all options, type a '??', or one at a time, type a '?'.
.*R*
To see a specific option, type HELP (WHOM.X) OPTIONS optionname.
.*B* SYSID
[S[YSID] =] sysid
 
where "sysid" is a decimal number of 6 digits or less.  This option puts WHOM
into the single user display, monitoring the user with the system
identification number specified.  When "sysid" is 0 the program will ignore
this option, execute one default multiple user display, and exit.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: XIT,QUIT,END,INTERVAL,ROLL,COUNT
.*B* USER
[U[SER] =] .usr
 
where "usr" is a octal number of 3 digits or less.  This option puts WHOM into
the single user display, monitoring the user with the user identification
number specified.  When "usr" is 0 the program will ignore this option, execute
one default multiple user display, and exit.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: XIT,QUIT,END,INTERVAL,ROLL,COUNT
.*B* FEP
F[EP] = fep
 
where "fep" is a decimal number representing the front end processor number
which you wish to monitor.  This option causes the program to display users on
the specified FEP.  When "fep" is 0 the program exits after one default
multiple user display.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: XIT,QUIT,END,INTERVAL,ROLL,COUNT
.*B* ACCT
A[CCT] [~] = accn
 
where "accn" specifies the account number of the user(s) that you wish to
monitor.  Wildcarding is permitted.  This option always produces the multiple
user display.  Note that the B,O,G,T option is allowed here.  (The default is
O,B) The '~' specifies that these user(s) are NOT to be selected.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS:  All except MEMORY, USER, and SYSID
.*B* NAME
N[AME] [~] = uname
 
where "uname" specifies the account name of the user(s) that you wish to
monitor.  Wildcarding is permitted.  This option will always produce the
multiple user display.  Note that the B,O,G,T option is allowed here.  (The
default is O,B) The '~' specifies that these user(s) are NOT to be selected.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: All except USER, SYSID, and NAME
.*B* LASTBATCH
L[ASTBATCH]
 
this option causes the program to monitor the last batch job submitted for this
session.  If the job has completed, the program exits after the memory info has
been displayed.  If there has been no job submitted during the current session,
the program ignores this option and exits after one default multiple user
display.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: XIT,END,QUIT,INTERVAL,ROLL,COUNT
.*B* BOGT O G T
B, O, G, T
 
any or all of B,O,G,T separated by commas causes the program to display all
users who are running in the corresponding mode.  (Batch, Online, TP, Ghost)
(DEFAULT = O,B)
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: All except SYSID, USER, and MEMORY
.*B* INTERVAL
I[NTERVAL] = nseconds
 
where "nseconds" is a decimal number specifying the number of seconds to wait
between updates.  (Default is 5 seconds)
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS:  All except MEMORY.
.*B* END QUIT XIT
{E[ND]|Q[UIT]|X[IT]}
 
any one of these will cause the program to exit after one display.  (Default is
continue, for appropriate terminals)
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: All (Redundant with MEMORY)
.*B* ROLL
R[OLL]
 
force scrolling mode.  Default is don't scroll.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: All (Redundant with MEMORY)
.*B* COUNT
C[OUNT] = iterations
 
where "iterations" is a decimal number specifying the number of iterations.
COUNT = 1 is the same as specifying XIT,END, or QUIT.  COUNT =0 is the same as
COUNT = 1.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: All except MEMORY
.*B* MEMORY
M[EMORY]
 
this option displays the bottom lines and exits.  The bottom lines consist of
number of users, memory usage, and time. *NOTE* The field 'memory' indicates
the total memory in use by B, O, G, T users. The monitor is not counted.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: None
.*B* $
$
 
This option causes the program to display the user name instead of account
number in the multiple user display.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: All except USER, SYSID, and MEMORY
.*B* PARTITION
P[ARTITIONS]
 
This option causes the multiple user display to show the partition number for
batch users. Due to space limitations, the program shares the field 'state with
partition, by alternating between the two each interval. Partition number is
displayed as *pn* where pn is the partition number.
 
COMPATIBLE OPTIONS: All except USER, SYSID, and MEMORY.
.*K* COMPATIBLE_OPTIONS
Option compatibility rules:
 
The MEMORY option ALWAYS overides all other options.
 
The ACCT or NAME options overide LASTBATCH, SYSID and USER.
 
END,QUIT,XIT ALWAYS overide INTERVAL and COUNT.
 
The last LASTBATCH,SYSID or USER option in an invocation overides any other
LASTBATCH,SYSID or USER.
.*K* DCBS
WHOM writes through M$LO when in the scroll (tty) mode. This dcb is not
explicitly opened. To route WHOMs output to a file, it is necessary to !SET
M$LO fid,CTG
.*K* EXAMPLES
Examples:
 
 !WHOM.X A=?TAC?,E
 !"   display all users whose account number contains 'TAC' and exit.
 
 !WHOM.X A~=?TAC?,E
 !"   display all users whose account number DOES NOT contain 'TAC'
 !"   and exit.
 
 !WHOM.X
 !"   display all batch and online users.  Wait 5 seconds and repeat.
 
 !WHOM.X FEP=1,INT=60
 !"   display all users on FEP 1.  Wait 60 seconds and repeat.
 
 !WHOM.X 32619
 !"   monitor the user with the sysid 32619.
 
 !WHOM.X .23,X,R
 !"   display the user with the user number 23 in scroll mode,exit.
 
 Type ? for more examples.
.*B*
 !WHOM.X N=B?,B,O,G,E
 !"   display users whose account name starts with 'B', whose mode
 !"   is Batch, Online, or Ghost and then exit.
 
 !WHOM G,A~=:SYS,$
 !"   this example will monitor GHOST users whose ACCOUNT is NOT ':SYS'.
 !"   The account names will be displayed instead of the account numbers.
 
.*K* NOTES
For the single user display, an '*' in place of the '-' between the fep number
and line number indicates a suspended user.  In the multiple user display this
is indicated by an 's' in the mode field.  It is advisable to turn pagehalt off
prior to running WHOM with a multiple user display.
