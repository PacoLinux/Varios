Description:
.FIN
MOLE is a preprocessor that is used to divide a CP-6 ELF error log
file into one or more indexed files, each file with the ANS date
(yymmdd) appended to its name, and containing only those records
from the input file pertinent to that date.  The resultant file(s)
are suitable for use by the SHREW program.

Syntax:
     !MOLE.X :ELFnn.:SYS OVER .account
 
Parameters:
.FIN
.INL +12
.unl 12
:ELFnn.:SYS - specifies the log file built by CP-6 ELF to be filtered
into separate files for use by SHREW.  Normally the filename is ":ELF"
followed by a two-digit number in the range 04 through 99, and the
file resides in .:SYS; however, MOLE does not require the filename
to be of any special format nor the file to reside in .:SYS.
.unl 12
`account - specifies the account into which MOLE is to build the
individual indexed daily log files.  If unspecified, the user's
file management account (or M$OU assignment) is used by default.

`*K* EXAMPLE
EXAMPLE:
 
     !MOLE.X :ELF97
 
.FIN
In the above example, the file :ELF97 in the current file management
account is divided into separate files based upon date, stored in
the current FMA.
.FIF
.SPB 1
     !MOLE.X :ELF08.:SYS OVER .LOGACCT
 
.FIN
In the above example, the file :ELF08.:SYS is divided into separate
files based upon date, stored into the .LOGACCT account.
.FIF
.SPB 1
     !MOD :ELF?.:SYS TO HOLD_ELF?
     !COPY HOLD_ELF?.:SYS TO *MOLE_INPUT
     !DEL  HOLD_ELF?.:SYS
     !MOLE.X *MOLE_INPUT OVER .LOGACCT
 
.FIN
In the above example, any :ELF? files are modified (so subsequent
M$WRSYSLOG calls will build new files), merged into *MOLE_INPUT,
and then discarded.  Next, MOLE is used to divide the merged file
into separate files based on both log number and date, and all are
then stored into the .LOGACCT account.

separate daily log files it uses.

TOOL=MOLE
MOLE is a preprocessor of CP-6 ELF-generated user error logs to
prepare files suitable for input to SHREW.
