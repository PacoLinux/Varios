 
SKUNK - Keeps someone else from using your terminal while you're away.
 
Usage: !SKUNK
 
SKUNK will greet you with his name and version and then go
to sleep, snoring every five minutes.  When you want your terminal
back, provide the password (you won't get a prompt).  If that password
matches your log-on password, SKUNK goes away.  Otherwise, he'll yell
at you and go back to sleep.
 
Usage notes:
 1. You must provide your log-on password to get your terminal back.
    This prevents someone from causing too much trouble by SKUNKing
    your terminal behind your back.
 2. If you stay in SKUNK for more than an hour, SKUNK will decide
    that you're not coming back... and log you off.
 3. If the line drops, skunk will log you off.
 
System notes:
 1. SKUNK must be invoked from :SYS.
 2. The IMP processor must be present and operable in :SYS.
 3. The snore interval and time-out delay can be easily modified
