         NEW COMMANDS...
 
         PAGE,
                   (PAGE,WIDTH=val,DEPTH=val,STRIKES=val)
 
         This command describes the page to be created. WIDTH=val
    is the maximum number of columns on the page. DEPTH=val is
    the maximum number of rows on the page and STRIKES=val is the maximum
    number of print strikes allowed.
 
         All text commands must now have a ROW=val and a COL=val
    in the command line to give the starting position for
    the upper left corner of the first letter in the text. If
    ROW and COL are not specified. Then the last given value is used.
 
         FILE,
                   (FILE=fid,ROW=val,COL=val)
 
         This command allow the user to position a print file on the
    page defined. The file must contain VFC in the first
    column. The only two acceptable VFC are (`= print with no upspace)
    and (A= print and upspace one). The file will be read until
    end-of-file or the end of the page is reached.
