CMLOAD examines and loads firmware in the IPC-IPI channels and CMs associated
MDS disks.
Syntax:
 
!CMLOAD.X
 
Parameters:     None
 
Description:
 
The CMLOAD program is used to READ the CM firmware tape into memory,
LOAD the CM firmware into CM(s), and REPORT the configuration of
the IPC-IPI channel or the MDS disk subsystem.
 
The READ command is used to read the CM firmware tape into memory.
The firmware must be read into memory before it can be loaded into
the CM(s) on the MDS disk subsystem.
 
The LOAD command is used to load the CM firmware into the selected
CM.  The READ command must have been used prior to using the LOAD
command.  The LOAD command must be repeated for each CM connected
to the disk controller (DCnn).
 
The REPORT command is used to report the configuration of either
IPC-IPI channel or the entire MDS disk subsystem.  This command
can be used to determine the current IPC-IPI configuration and
the CM and device numbers attached to the IPC-IPI.

Changed the LOAD command so that only one CM could be loaded at once.
This change was required because (1) LADC did not have more than
one CM cabinet to do testing of CM firmware loading, and (2) a
customer found that loiading multiple CMs with a single LOAD command
did not work. (Star #40592).  So now a LOAD command must be repeated
for each CM connected to a disk controller (DCnn).
Version changed to A03.

Added checks to determine whether all channels to controller are
partitioned.  If all channels are partitioned, no I/O operations
are possible.  An error message is output to report this condition.
(star #40586).
Version changed to A02.

Fixed problem of CMLOAD not recognizing MDS disk cabinets with
less than 8 drives as being configured.  (Star #40583).
Version changed to A01.

Began developing the CMLOAD program.
 
The commands are entered following the "CMLOAD?" prompt.
The commands are used to READ the CM firmware tape, LOAD the
CM firmware into the controller, perform a power-on RESET to a
specific CM controller, and REPORT on the configuraton of the
IPC-IPI channel and the CM controller.
 
The commands accepted by the CMLOAD program are::
 
        Command         Description
        -------         ------------
        LOAD            Load CM firmware into CM controller.
        READ            Read CM firmware tape into memory.
        REPORT          Report IPC or CM configuration.
        RESET           Perform a power-on reset to a CM controller.

DCBS:
 
The CMLOAD program uses the following DCBS:
 
DCB             Usage:
-----           ---------------------------
F$FIRMWARE      To read CM firmware tape.
F$IOQ           To do M$IOQ requests.
F$TDIO          To do T&D IO requests.
M$DO            To output error messages.
M$LM            To get run unit name.
M$LO            To output reports and messages.
M$ME            To output the greeting.
M$SI            To read commands.
 
Environment:
 
The CMLOAD program runs as a user program.  It requires the TND, EXMM,
IOQ and IOQW privileges.
 
For the REPORT command, nothing needs to be partitioned.  For the
LOAD command, the controller MUST BE partitioned, but the channels
to the controller MUST NOT BE partitionted.
 
Input:
 
The input to the CMLOAD program is CMLOAD commands and the CM firmware
tape.  The CM firmware tape is distributed to CP-6 sites as a free form
(i.e., unlabeled) tape.  The contents of the CM firmware tape can be
copied to a disk file using the following PCL command:
 
COPY FT#CM3(DEOD) TO filename
 
This file can then be optionally used as input to CMLOAD.
 
Installation:
 
The CMLOAD processor can be installed in any account. The CMLOAD_CRU
batch job can be used to install the processor and its related files
from the source account into any other (or the same) account.  The
following files must be installed in the same account as the CMLOAD
run unit for proper operation of this processor:

Parameters:     None
 
Description:
 
The CMLOAD program is used to READ the CM firmware tape into memory,
LOAD the CM firmware into CM(s), and REPORT the configuration of
the IPC-IPI channel or the MDS disk subsystem.
 
The READ command is used to read the CM firmware tape into memory.
The firmware must be read into memory before it can be loaded into
the CM(s) on the MDS disk subsystem.
 
The LOAD command is used to load the CM firmware into the selected
CMs.  The READ command must have been used prior to using the LOAD
command.
 
The REPORT command is used to report the configuration of either
IPC-IPI channel or the entire MDS disk subsystem.  This command
can be used to determine the current IPC-IPI configuration and
the CM and device numbers attached to the IPC-IPI.

Syntax:         LOAD DCnn ( CM = m )
 
Parameters:
 
nn              specifies the disk controller name given to the
IPC-IPI channel to which the CM is attached.  "nn" must be
between 00 and 99, inclusive.
 
m               specifies a single CM number.  "m" must be between
0 and 7, inclusive.
 
Description:
 
The LOAD command loads the CM firmware into the selected CM
attached to the specified disk controller (DCnn).
 
The CM firmware must have previously been read into memory using
the READ command.
 
The disk controller (DCnn) must have been previously partitioned
using SYSCON.  However, the IOM and the logical channels connected to
DCnn should be RETURNed (under SYSCON).
 
The LOAD command must be repeated for each CM connected to the
disk controller (DCnn).  Each CM must be loaded with the same
firmware.
 
Examples:
 
LOAD DC03(CM=1)         Loads CM firmware into CM 1 attached to DC03.

Syntax:         READ FT#sn [ ( DENSITY = { 800 | 1600 | 6250 } ) ]
 
Parameters:
 
sn              specifies the serial number of the tape to be read.
        "sn" must be the 1 to 6 character reel number used to mount
        the firmware tape.
 
Description:
 
The READ command is used to read the CM firmware tape into memory.
 
If not specified, DENSITY=1600 is assumed.
 
Examples:
 
READ FT#CMIFAD          Reads the free-tape CMIFAD at 1600 bpi.

Syntax:         REPORT DCnn [ ( IPC | SUBSYSTEM ) ]
 
Parameters:
 
nn              specifies the disk controller name given to the
        IPC-IPI channel to which the CM is attached.  "nn" must be
        between 00 and 99, inclusive.
 
IPC             specifies that the IPC-IPI configuration report
is to be done.
 
SUBSYSTEM       specifies that the MDS subsystem configuration report
is to be done.  SUBSYSTEM may be abbreviated SS.
 
Description:
 
The REPORT command is used to report either the IPC or SUBSYSTEM
configuration for the selected disk controller (DCnn).  If not specified,
SUBSYSTEM is the default.
 
Examples:
 
REPORT DC01 (IPC)       Reports the configuration from the IPC-IPI.
 
REPORT DC02 (SUB)       Reports the subsystem configuration.

Syntax:         RESET DCnn ( CM= {m|ALL|(m1,m2,...)} )
 
Parameters:
 
nn              specifies the disk controller name given to the
IPC-IPI channel to which the CM is attached.  "nn" must be
between 00 and 99, inclusive.
 
m               specifies a single CM number.  "m" must be between
0 and 7, inclusive.
 
ALL             specifies ALL CMs attached to DCnn.
 
m1,m2,...       specifies a list of CM numbers.  Each number must
be between 0 and 7, inclusive.
 
Description:
 
The RESET issues a power-on RESET command to the selected CM(s)
attached to the specified disk controller (DCnn).
 
This command should only be attempted after attempts to LOAD the
CM have failed.  If the RESET is successful, the LOAD of the firmware
can be re-attempted.  If the CM fails to load again, manual interven-
tion will be necessary.
 
The disk controller (DCnn) must have been previously partitioned
using SYSCON.  However, the IOM and the logical channels connected to
DCnn should be RETURNed (under SYSCON).
 
Examples:
 
RESET DC03(CM=1)         Issues a power-on reset to CM 1 attached to DC03.
 
RESET DC05(CM=(0,2,4))   Resets CMs 0, 2, and 4 attached to DC05.
