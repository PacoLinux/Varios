GIN displays or changes attributes of existing run units.
GIN is used to update an existing run unit and change many of the values that
were specified when the RU was linked.  It does not affect the location or
structure of procedure, data or overlay information.  It does let you change
privilege bits, run unit attributes, DCB positions, shared library names,
alternate shared library names and increase existant patch space.
 
GIN will also let you display the attributes in an existing run unit.  You do
not need to be able to update the run unit to use this feature.

GIN.X Has been made year 2000 ready. Please see star #40714
12/01/95 - MAM
Fixed DCBSLOTS command to set DCB slots to what asked for, not just add it.
09/28/94 - RWL
Fixed problem with packset name handling. (42709)
09/24/93 - PAR
Fixed patch extension again.  Will I ever get it right? (41857)
Apparently not (11/23/93) - Added DA_MSCPG3 for PREF
 8/29/90 - PAR
Fixed patch extension for libraries with defs removed (40169).
900131 - DEW
Changed so DEF-stackless rununits have more chance of working. (#39198)
11/10/89 - Fixed patch extension to endof page with start in previous page.
           (See star 38968)
6/8/88 - Added new FEPLINK option LAUTO.
9/14/87
Added the following commands:
    DPATCH, IPATCH, PATCHS
Added the following options to the DISPLAY command:
    DPATCH, IPATCH, PATCHS
The above commands work on both FEP and HOST run units and replace the
ESP processor previously residing on the "X" account.
7/28/86
Fixed the NSTDINVOC flag which was backwards.
5/2/86
Will try and open the file shared if necessary.
12/31/85
Fixed HELP documentation of PRIMARY command.
12/3/84
Fixed memory fault if optional list left off of some commands.
10/11/84
Fixed numeric DCB's to be preceeded by F$.
Recognize RU's without a ROSEG.
09/15/84
Added the following commands:
    KEEP, PRIMARY, REMOVE, REPLACE and SECONDARY
which all affect external definitions in a run unit.
06/19/84
Submitted to X account.
XUG commands:
 
    ! ?, ??, DATE, DIRECTORY, DO, END, ERASE, HELP, XIT, QUIT
 
LINK originating commands:
 
    ALTSHARELIB, DCB, DCBSLOTS, DPATCH, IPATCH, LAUTO, LODCB,
    N, NDCB, NOALTSHARELIB, NOCHGPMEM, NOSHARELIB, NSHAREABLE,
    OUDCB, PRIVILEGES, PROCACC, SHAREABLE, SHARELIB, SIDCB,
    SLOCK, STDINVOC, SURCHARGE, TCB, UIDCB, WLOCK
 
Alternate syntax for LINK commands:
 
    #1, #2, #3, #4, N#1, N#2, N#3, N#4
 
GIN specific commands:
 
    DI, DPATCH, FLAVOR, IPATCH, KEEP, PRIMARY, PATCH, PSEUDOFLAVOR,
    REMOVE, REPLACE, SECONDARY
 
Commands are divided into three major categories.  The first category are the
display commands.  These can be used to display various values from within the
run unit.  Everything that can be updated by this tool can be displayed using
this command.  All of these commands begin with DISPLAY.  (See HELP DISPLAY for
more information.)
 
The second category are the commands used for updating the run unit.
Most of these commands come from the options that can be specified when
performing a LINK.  As much as possible the same syntax and abbreviations has
been kept for these commands.  Some additions have been made to provided for
compatibility with other tools.  For example #1 is synonymous with DCB1.
 
The final category consists of only one command.  This is the PSEUDOFLAVOR
command which allows you to specify how to treat this run unit if it has a
flavor other than HOST or FEP.

The DISPLAY command allows you to display various attributes of a run unit.
You can display information in run units even if you cannot update them.
 
    DP[ATCH]
 
Enlarges the data patch space a maximum of 1 page per invocation.
 
    FL[AVOR] = { 'HOST' | 'FEP' | integer }
 
Changes the actual flavor of the run unit.
 
The syntax for invoking GIN is:
 
    !GIN.X ru_fid [(commands[,...][)]]
 
If the optional command list is present, GIN is invoked as a one shot process
and exits when the commands have been processed.  If the command list is
omitted, GIN will prompt for successive commands against the ru_fid.
 
    IP[ATCH]
 
Enlarges the instruction patch space a maximum of 1 page per invocation.
 
           { ARE[ADEF] }
           { ENT[DEF]  }
    KEE[P] { SEG[DEF]  }  [ ( symbol [, . . .] ) ]
           { SYM[DEF]  }
 
Keeps only those definitions of the type specified that were in
the list of symbols.  All others are removed.  Each symbol can
also be a wildcard specification.
 
For LINK compatible commands say:
    HELP (LINK) OPTIONS option-name
 
N# is a synonym for the prefix NDCB.

Steve Cohen, LADC
    PA[TCHS]
 
Enlarges both then data and instruction patch spaces a maximum of 1 page
for each patch space per invocation.
PRIM[ARY] ENT[DEF] ( symbol [, . . . ] )
 
Marks the symbol as a primary ENTDEF.  Each symbol can also be a
wildcard specification.
 
    PSE[UDOFLAVOR] = { 'HOST' | 'FEP' }
 
Tells GIN to make believe the run unit is of this flavor so GIN knows what the
format of the file is.
 
             { ARE[ADEF] }
             { ENT[DEF]  }
    REM[OVE] { SEG[DEF]  }  [ ( symbol [, . . .] ) ]
             { SYM[DEF]  }
 
Removes definitions of the type specified that were in
the list of symbols.  Each symbol can also be a wildcard
specification.
 
              { ARE[ADEF] }
              { ENT[DEF]  }
    REP[LACE] { SEG[DEF]  }  [ ( symbol [, . . .] ) ]
              { SYM[DEF]  }
 
Replaces definitions of the type specified that were in
the list of symbols.  Each symbol can also be a wildcard
specification.
 
SEC[ONDARY] ENT[DEF] ( symbol [, . . . ] )
 
Marks the symbol as a secondary ENTDEF.  Each symbol can also be a
wildcard specification.  This has the most use for the FORTRAN
and COBOL library which have a primary ENTDEF in data.  To
facilitate debugging you want to remove these ENTDEF's.
For FORTRAN remove:
    .XPT_8TO_D
For COBOL remove:
    .CDBUG
