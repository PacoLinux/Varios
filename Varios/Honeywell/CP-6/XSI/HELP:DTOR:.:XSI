Converts files containing PL6 DCL statements and preprocessor directives
into files with DEF-type DCLs changed to REF-type and/or BASED ones.
SYMDEF or AREADEF on DCLs and macro invocations becomes SYMREF or AREAREF
and/or BASED.
 
!DTOR.X  si-file[,ui-file] [OVER .acct]  [(opt, ... opt)]
 
Options are:
   LIST - Use a list-file (F$LIST)
   NOUI - If UI file is specified but doesn't exits, don't abort
   OPTUI - If UI file is specified but doesn't exist, don't abort
   NOMODDIM - Specifies that the dimensions of level 1 arrayed
              items are not to be modified.  The default is to
              change the upper dimension to 8191 if the upper
              dimension is not numeric (preprocessor variable).
 
If ui-file has nothing for the file name (. or .acct), the name used will
be the name from si-file.  The output files are named automatically
and placed in the account specified by acct or in the current
file-management account.
 
By default, only the SYMREF file is created.  Commands may be embedded
in the input file to control where output is to go.  Commands are of
the form:
   /*  ! c ! s */
where c is nothing, R and/or $.  R indicates that output is to be
enabled to the SYMREF file (the default).  $ indicates that output
is to be enabled to the BASED file.  Neither indicates that nothing
is to be output.  The field s is anything that is to be put into
whatever output file is currently enabled but is not to be part
of the source file.  If either the R or $ is followed by I, then
that file is enabled, but the source info is put into it without
change.
