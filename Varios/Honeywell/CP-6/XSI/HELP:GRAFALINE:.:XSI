GRAFALINE creates single-page line graphs and/or scatter plots of the
user-supplied input data.
Full command line syntax:
 
!GRAFALINE.X [input_file] OVER graphics_file[,listing_file][(options)]
 
(at the moment, there are several incarnations of GRAFALINE in .X; GRAFALINE
(for the laserprinter), GRAFALINEDEC (for the DECVT125 and DECVT241),
GRAFALINETEK (for 4010-compatibles) and GRAFALINEDMP (for the HIDMP29).  Use
the version that matches the device you are using.)
 
where:
 
input_file     is a file of GRAFALINE input in the format described below.
[Default is to prompt for data from the terminal.] DCB is F$10.
 
graphics_file  is the place you want the graphics to go; it must be specified.
DCB is GRAPHICS00.
 
listing_file   is the place you want the GRAFALINE "LO" to go to.  If you're
reading an input_file from a file, you probably want to say NO for this.  DCB
is F$108.
 
options are:
               BORDER - to create a 5% border around your chart.
               FRAME  - to draw a "frame" around the active plotting area.
 
input_data is prompted for, but always in the same order:
 
 Input title of plot (80 char max)
 Title along X-axis (40 char max, [,GRID])
 Title along Y-axis (40 char max, [,GRID])
 Input notation test (40 char max)
 Number of lines to be plotted (1-4)
 "Title" of line #1(12 char max,[,NOLINE][,LINREG])
 Now input X,Y pairs for line #1
 input <escape-F> or !EOD to stop inputting
 
 
At this point, data for each "line" is accepted, each followed by a !EOD record
in XEQ files or files or, separated by pressing the ESCAPE key, then the F key
in an interactive timesharing session.  Note that each line has a title at the
beginning of the set of its input data.  There is a limit of 200 points per
line.
 
"LINE DATA" is just X-Y pairs of floating point numbers.
 
If the NOLINE option is added to a line's title, a scatterplot of that "line's"
data will be made.  If the LINREG option is added to a line's title, that
line's data will be analyzed to produce a dashed least-squares linear
regression line.
 
If the GRID option is added to an axis title, a dotted background grid will be
created that is anchored to that axis.  Grid lines going both directions
require that GRID be input for both the X and Y axes.
If the title for any line is blank, no "legend" will be printed for that line.
 
If the title for a line is "DUMMY LABEL", data for the line will be accepted,
but neither the legend or the line will appear.  The value of DUMMY LABEL
forces the data to be used as a way to "force the scaing" to be outside the
range that GRAFALINE will automatically pick.
GRAFALINE uses the CP-6 DIGS graphics system, which is a separately priced
product.  If you don't have it, maybe you should!  It's not that expensive.
