LEECH (LEE's CHase program) checks any or all of the indexes in an INDEXED
file for file and/or data inconsistencies.  If any are found, then useful
information is printed to assist Bull HN employees in finding what the problem
with the file is.  Whether or not there is a problem with the file, at the
conclusion of the search each index, a record count and elapsed time used to
check the index is printed.
Invocation syntax:
 !LEECH.X indexed-file[,cmd-file] [{ON|TO|OVER|INTO},listing] [(options[)]]
 
where:
 indexed-file    The INDEXED file to be checked (read through the F$IN DCB).
                 Note: If it is desired to run LEECH on a file that is being
                       SHARED by others, the following SET is required:
                        !SET F$IN indexed-file,SHARE=ALL
                       If this method is used, DO NOT specify "indexed-file"
                       on the LEECH invocation line.  Since this method makes
                       LEECH run somewhat slower, it should ONLY be used when
                       it is not possible to give LEECH exclusive access to
                       the file.
 cmd-file        A file containing LEECH commands.  This file is read
                 through the M$SI DCB.  Default is ME.
 listing         This specifies where LEECHs primary output, written through
                 the M$LO DCB, is to be written.  Default is ME.
 options         One or more LEECH options.
 
For a list of available options, type '?' or 'HELP (LEECH.X) TOPICS'
For a description of a specific option, type 'HELP (LEECH.X) option'
For a description of all options, type 'HELP (LEECH.X) A - Z'
In the list below, only characters before the slash(/) are required.

If LEECH is run online and BREAK is hit while a CHECK or CHASE is in progress,
a message indicating what record LEECH is currently processing will be printed.

CHECK
{CHE/CK | CHA/SE | T/ALLY} [I/NDEX | K/EYS] [index# | A/LL]
  [I/NDEXES | K/EYS] [[,] K/EYS [O/NLY]]
  [[,] {INC/REMENTED [B/Y] | INF/ORM [ON OC] [E/VERY]} nrecs [R/ECORDS]]
  [[,] C/OUNT [D/UPLICATES]]
    Indicates which index(es) are to be checked, where:
      index# is an integer indicating which index is to be checked.
             This value can be between 1 and the number of indexes in the
             file being searched.
      nrecs  if INCremented and Keys Only are specified this value indicates
             how many record indexes will be skipped at a time (via M$PRECORD).
             If INForm Every is specified, then LEECH will output a message
             every 'nrecs' records indicating where it is in your file.
             If the ON OC phrase is specified, the INFORM message is also
             displayed on the Operators Console.  If Count Duplicates is
             specified, LEECH will indicate how many records in the file have
             unique keys and how many have duplicates (if duplicates are
             allowed for the index being checked).
      Note: If 'KEYS ONLY' is specified, the CHECK will be significantly
            faster but only the KEYS/INDEXes will be checked (i.e. no "data"
            will be checked) thus only errors in the index granules will be
            detected.  Also, for this option to be most efficient, DO NOT
            specify the COUNT option.
For some examples, type 'Help (LEECH.X) EXamples'.
CHANGES
{ E/ND | EX/IT | X/IT | Q/UIT }
    Exits LEECH setting the STEPCC to zero if no indexes had errors or 4 if
    any did.
To CHECK all indexes in the current file:
    CHECK
 
To CHECK only the INDEXes (but no data):
    CHECK, KEYS ONLY
 
To CHECK index 2, the first alternate key, and be informed every 1000 records,
you could type:
    CHECK 2, INFORM EVERY 1000 RECORDS  or with a little less typing:
    CHE 2, INF 1000
 
To list information on the indexes of the current file:
    List
 
To list information about the first and third indexes:
    List Indexes 1,3
 
To CHECK a file that is being SHARED by others:
    !SET F$IN indexed-file,SHARE=ALL
    !LEECH.X
    CHECK ALL

H/ELP [(processor)][ TOPICS ][ keyword1 ][ - ][ keyword2]
 where:
processor - specifies a program or processor that has an associated HELP file.
            The default is the processor currently under control (in this case,
            LEECH).
 
TOPICS    - specifies that only a list of available topics (message names) is
            required.  The range of topics is determined by keyword1 or
            keyword2.
 
keyword1  - specifies the name of the message to be printed.
 
keyword2  - if a range is specified (by including a dash " - " or greater
            than ">"), keyword2 is the upper limit of the range.  If a range is
            not specified, keyword2 is a submessage, or category within a
            message.
HELP prints information.
 
HELP messages have levels.  Once the initial level has been printed, typing a
question mark prints the next level, usually containing greater detail.
Typing two question marks prints the entire message.
 
Any processor with a standard HELP file can be read from LEECH.
 
The HELP can be issued at the double-bang (!!) without losing the suspended
activity.  Thus, one may exit a processor (such as FORTRAN) with a <CNTL><Y>,
query for HELP information, and then issue GO to return to FORTRAN.
L/IST [I/NDEX] [ (indx#[...,indx#] | A/LL) ]
    Lists information about the specified index(es).  Information such as the
    index number, indexes starting position in the record (based from zero),
    index length (in bytes) and an indication of whether duplicate keys are
    allowed for that index.

If ANY indexes CHECKed were bad, LEECH will set the STEPCC to 4; otherwise it
will be set to zero.
