Syntax: !WAIT [[FOR] num [{SEC/ONDS|MIN/UTES|HOUR/S}]] [Q/UIETLY]
 
WAIT may be used to wait any amount of time up to a maximum time limit.  If no
time is specified, WAIT will wait to the maximum allowable.  At no time,
however, may the waiting be longer than one day.
 
If QUIETLY is specified, no messages will be printed when the WAITing starts or
stops.
.*K* MAX_TIME
The RUMable value MAX_TIME can be used to control the maximum amount of time
that can be WAITed, in seconds.  This is initially set to six hours.
