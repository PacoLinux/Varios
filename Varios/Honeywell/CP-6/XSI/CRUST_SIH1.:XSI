FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
CRUST  (Compare RunUnit Size Tool) compares two rununits and determines if any
of the linked-in modules have changed in size.  It does not determine if they
differ in content.
.*B*
Full command line syntax:
 
!CRUST.X rununit1, rununit2 [OVER ,output_file] [(options)]
 
where:
 
 rununit1 and rununit2 are the names of the rununits or files containing output
from a !MAP of the run unit.
 
 output_file is an optional place to put the results of the CRUST run.
 
Options are: FCG
.*B*
Here are detailed descriptions of the options and their actions.
 
FCG means give a break down by the first letter of the module name.
.*R*
.*B*
CRUST compares two files that were created by the !MAP command to see which
modules have changed in size, been added or deleted.  It prints the Results
through M$LO.  It tabulates total change at the end of each node, if the
rununit has overlays, and at the end of the file.  CRUST does not compare the
instructions that have been generated by two different compiles and links, just
the number of instructions that have been generated by two seperate compiles
and links.
