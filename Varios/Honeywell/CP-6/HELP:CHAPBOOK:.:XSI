CHAPBOOK is a tool used to group files together into a "book" with marks
between the "chapters".
Command syntax:
 
  !CHAPBOOK.X fid1 TO/ON/OVER/INTO fid2 [(S/TART='start mark',E/ND='end
mark'[)]]
 
where:
 fid1 - the (usually wildcarded) input or "chapter" file(s).
 fid2 - the output or "book" file.
 start mark - the prefix to the mark which will be put between "chapters".
 end mark - the suffix to the mark which will be put between "chapters".
 
If the starting and ending marks are not specified the defaults are start mark
= '.***** ' and end mark = ' *****' These marks are appropriate for use with
TEXT type files.  Other starting and ending marks can be specified for other
files.  For example, if you were putting PL6 modules back-to-back, you might
use START='%EOD; /* ',END=' */'
 
CHAPBOOK is intended for use with source files.
 
CHAPBOOK builds files which can be used as input to the tool BOOKCHAP which
does the opposite function. That is: BOOKCHAP takes books built by CHAPBOOK and
puts them back into their respective chapters and files.  For more information
type HELP (BOOKCHAP.X).
EXAMPLE:
 
!CHAPBOOK.X CHAPT?.X OVER BOOK.X (START='/*  **** ',END=' **** */')
 
This command will take all files that begin with CHAPT out of the X account and
combine them together into a file named BOOK.X.
 
Before each chapter a line will be inserted which has the format:
/* **** fid **** */
where fid is the name of the input file (eg. CHAPTER_1)
No more help is available for CHAPBOOK.
