 
CD: - Copies and deletes all files with a given prefix.
 
     The default prefix is 'D:'.
 
     Invoke as: !CD:.X [ fid ] [ (... ]
 
     Any options ( "(..." ) cause files to be copied only.
 
     Hitting BREAK will cause CD: to ask you
         Break hit:    Enter C,F,Q or ?:
 
          where: C means to continue
                 F means to skip to the next File
                 Q means to Quit CD: NOW!
                 ? gives you the above explaination of the choices
 
     Fid is M$SI or #1; output is through M$ME or #4.

Fixed two problems:
  1.  If CD: can't copy the entire file to you, it will not delete
      it anymore.
  2.  Break handling is more robust. Type  HELP (CD:.X)   for more
      info.
