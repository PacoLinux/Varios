GETLOADED is a run unit that allows you to make a run unit out of an APL
workspace.
To use GETLOADED, put EDIT-style keys on your workspace, and copy GETLOADED
INTO your workspace file with PCL...like so:
 
!C APLWS OVER APLWS(LN)
!C GETLOADED.X INTO APLWS
 ..Copying
 
Now, instead of saying
!APL APLWS
 
You can just say:
!APLWS.
 
Note that the full command line syntax is available including setting input and
output fids.  If the command line specified a fid for #2 (M$UI) or #3 (M$OU) or
options were specified, the $QSP system variable will be assigned the value of
these options.  The value of $QSP will be a character vector containing the
following values separated by commas:
 
UI=fid  if #2 was specified on the command line.
OU=fid  if #3 was specified on the command line.
(...)   for the options appearing on the command line.
OVER    if #3 was specified preceded by OVER
INTO    if #3 was specified preceded by INTO
ON      if #3 was specified preceded by ON
 
SI=fid      if NODENUM is not equal to 0 and only one si name.  SI=(fidlist) if
NODENUM is not equal to 0 and more than 1 si name
 
where NODENUM is the constant symbol in GETLOADED that may be RUM'ed "M .2006 1
(0)" to control the handling of input file names.
At'sa bout alla help you gonna gets for GETLOADED.X.

08/27/88 ---  Back to M$UNFID to get the name of the workspace.
05/27/88 --- Added alternate setting of $QSP to all names in the si,ui position
including lists of more than 2 si files.  This mode is achieved by rumming
location .2006 to 1 from 0.
 
09/03/87 --- continued command lines and initializing the value of $QSP to the
settings of M$UI, M$OU and the options specified are now supported. Note:
initializing $QSP requires version E00 of CP-6 APL or later.
 
08/22/86 GETLOADED.X now uses M$LDTRC to get into APL (because the ECHO option
now works in C01).
 
02/14/86 Submitted to the X account.
