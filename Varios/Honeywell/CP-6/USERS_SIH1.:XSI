USERS converts user records from D00 :USERS and :HLP files to E00
user records.
 
!USERS.X
 
It uses the following DCBs:
 
 M$SI = D00 :USERS file; :USERS.:SYS.
 M$UI = D00 :HLP file; :HLP.:SYS
 M$OU = E00 :USERS file; named *USERS (converted).
 M$LO = E00 :HLP file; named *HLP (converted).
 
 The "account, name" of the converted :USERS will be listed
 through M$DO.
 
**Note**  The :PROJ file should be just copied over from
          D00 to E00.
CAUTION:--- There are records other than user definitions which
            reside in the :HLP file.  Is is recommended that these
            other records be removed before conversion is begun.
            Type HELP (USERS.X) HLP or a '?' for how to do this.
.*B*
The following JCL and program run create a copy of :HLP which will
contain only records pertaining to users.
!C :HLP.:SYS (SH) OVER *
!COPYPGM.X * OVER **HLP
IF 1='001'O
COPY ASIS
KEY IN
GO
 
The file **HLP contains the copy of :HLP with records for users only.
.*K* HLP
The :HLP file has not only user definitions, but some device
info too.  It is suggested to use the JCL to get a copy of the
:HLP file which will only have copies of the users records.
 
!C :HLP.:SYS (SH) OVER *
!COPYPGM.X * OVER **HLP
IF 1='001'O
COPY ASIS
KEY IN
GO
 
**HLP now contains the records to be run through USERS.X.

fault.
