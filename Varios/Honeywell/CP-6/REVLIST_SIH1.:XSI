FYI, this HELP file has been specially prepared to run through TUNA.X (LEN=79)
prior to running through HERMAN.  This action will guarantee that the lines of
text in it will fill a screen as much as possible, and that more lines will end
up per screen.

.*A*
REVLIST makes a list of people who have contributed to a review.
.*B*
REVLIST is used to make a MAIL command that defines the people who are either
on the initial reviewers list, or have contributed to the review.  This list
can then be used to send out announcements (like meetings, cnacellations or
closures).
 
.*B*
Syntax:
 
    !REVLIST.X fid [ [ON|OVER|INTO] result_fid ]
 
The fid identifies a "review file".  Assuming the fid is "x.y" REVLIST will
attempt to open permutations of the specification in the same manner as CRF.X.
That is:
    1) x.y
    2) x.:REVIEWS
    3) REV_x.:REVIEWS
