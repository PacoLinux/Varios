FILAGE allows an overall picture of file activity in the system to be
developed.  "Cold spots" which may be ready for archiving, either
actively or inactively, can be identified.
.*B*
FILAGE produces a report which gives an indication of how "old"
an account is by showing what percentage of its files fall into
different age categories.  If you have FMSEC, FILAGE can give
reports for all accounts followed by two account lists: one sorted
by the average access date of files in each account and one sorted
by the average modification date of file in each account.
 
To use:
 
!PRIV FMSEC   "if you want reports for all accounts
!FILAGE.X [.account]
 
Specifying an account limits the report to that account only, and
does not require FMSEC.
 
The report for each account includes the account name, the number of
file in the account, the average modification date range, the average
access date range, and a breakdown for both modification and access
dates.
.*B*
For example, the report:
 
*** $$EFT     000003 files ***
 modified 2 days     - 4 days         accessed 1 day      - 2 days
1 day    033% *******              | 1 day    033% *******
2 days   000%                      | 2 days   067% **************
4 days   033% *******              | 4 days   000%
2 weeks  033% *******              | 2 weeks  000%
 
means that account $$EFT contains 3 files.  On the average, files
were modified between 2 and 4 days ago, and accessed between 1 and 2
days ago.  The categories of the breakdown are: 1 hour, 2 hours,
4 hours, 8 hours, 16 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks,
1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 1 year, 2 years, 4 years, and more.  If,
for example, the modification date of a file fell in the range of 1
to 2 weeks ago, it would be accounted for in the "2 weeks" category.
Categories which contain no files are not printed.
 
In the above example, 33% of $$EFT files were modified between 1 week
and 2 weeks ago.   67% were accessed between 1 day and 2 days ago.
The asterisks represent a bar graph to draw attention to large
categories.
.*B*
If FMSEC is on and all accounts are scanned, FILAGE will produce a
report similar to the account report for the entire file system,
except the average modification and access ranges are not printed.
FILAGE will also produce a summaries for all accounts.  The first
summary is sorted by average access date, the second is sorted by
average modification date:
 
 most recent modified    files account  most recent accessed
 more        1 hour        no  :7700GN  more        1 hour
 1 day       4 days     000003 $$EFT    1 day       2 days
 2 years     2 years    000013 :3270TUI 2 days      2 days
 2 weeks     2 weeks    000002 :3270OU  4 days      1 week
 1 year      2 years    000039 :3270SI  4 days      2 months
 4 months    1 year     000023 :7700OU  4 months    4 months
 1 year      1 year     000003 :6B3TUI  1 year      1 year
 
 most recent modified    files account  most recent accessed
 more        1 hour        no  :7700GN  more        1 hour
 1 day       4 days     000003 $$EFT    1 day       2 days
 2 weeks     2 weeks    000002 :3270OU  4 days      1 week
 4 months    1 year     000023 :7700OU  4 months    4 months
 1 year      1 year     000003 :6B3TUI  1 year      1 year
 1 year      2 years    000039 :3270SI  4 days      2 months
 2 years     2 years    000013 :3270TUI 2 days      2 days
 
 (1)         (2)        (3)    (4)      (5)         (6)
 
Each report contains:
   (1) the category that the most recently modified file falls into
   (2) the category that the average modification date falls into
   (3) the number of files in the account
   (4) the account's name
   (5) the category that the most recently accessed file falls into
   (6) the category that the average access date falls into
 
Remember when interpreting these reports that each category contains
a range of dates ending with the category name.  "4 days" means
between 2 and 4 days ago, not including exactly 2 days ago.  2 days
and 1 second ago would fall into the "4 days" category.  Also remember
that categories are not printed if no files fall into that category.
Even though the account report might list "1 hour" and then "4 days",
the "1 hour" category contains files that have been accessed during
the last 1 hour.  The "4 days" category contains files that have been
accessed between 2 and 4 days ago, and does not mean that these files
have been accessed between 1 hour and 4 days ago.
 
Remember also that files in NOACUP accounts can be accessed without
their access dates changing.
 
From the above sorted report, assuming that no accounts have the
NOACUP attribute, we can determine that :3270SI could be a candidate
for active archiving since its files are recently accessed but not
recently modified.  :6B3TUI could be a candidate for inactive
archiving since its files are have neither been modified or accessed
recently.
