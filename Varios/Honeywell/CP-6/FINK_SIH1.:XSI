.*A*                                             
FINK (File INternals made Known) displays a file's internal information, like
the FIT codes array, the different codes, granule headers, and granules.
.*B* SYNTAX FORMAT
Syntax: !FINK.X sifid [{TO|ON|OVER|INTO} , lofid] [(option-list[)]]
 
sifid = File to be analyzed.
.*R*
lofid = Listing output file name.
 
Option-list = Any of the options (including none) separated by commas.
 
After the command line Option-list is executed, FINK will prompt with
 
FINK>>
 
At this point any Option-list option may be entered with delimited parenthesis
being optional.
 
Type HELP (FINK.X) OPTIONS.

.*K* OPEN OP
OPEN:       OP/EN sifid
 
The open option will open a new sifid.
 
.*K* FILE
FILE:       Same as OPEN
 
.*K* SHARE
SHARE:      SHARE [option]
 
Sets SHARE for the next OPEN/FILE command.
 
Valid options are ALL, IN, or NONE.  SHARE with no options prints the current
SHARE setting.
.*K* THISF
THISF:      Prints the name of the file currently opened.
 
.*K* NXTF
NXTF:       NXTF [(srchcond)]
 
Opens the next file in the account directory.
 
srchcond is a mask of bits that are used to select what files are to be found.
srchcond can be any of the following:
 
ANYF      ARCHIVE        BAD            BUF
.*R*
DELF      NOLIST         QS             REV

Services Manual.
 
.*K* NXTA
NXTA:       NXTA [SN=sn]
 
Specifies that the user wants to access a different account from the PAD if SN
is specified or from the MAD if SN is not specified. FINK will obtain the
account name following the  account specified in the DCB and then will change
the DCB to reflect this change.
 
.*K* FIT
FIT:        [DI/SPLAY] FIT
 
Displays the Fit codes array.
 
.*K* CODEn
CODEn:      [DI/SPLAY] [CODE] n
    where n is the code number.
 
Displays the specified code structure.
 
.*K* IRKEYS
IRKEYS:     IR/KEYS
 
Displays the IRKEYS structure in the read-only segment, for IREL files.
 
.*K* KEY
KEY:        K/EY n
 
Displays the FM$KEYENT structure for the specified key in the current granule.
The "n" parameter is used as an index into the key table.
 
.*K* KEYTBL
KEYTBL:     K/EY T/BL (abbreviation:  KT)
 
Performs a KEY command for each key in the key table.
 
.*K* REPORT RE
REPORT:     RE/PORT [format]
 
Report will display the current format for numerical output.  This format may
be changed by specifying one of the "format" options.
 
format can be  O/CTAL, D/ECIMAL, H/EXADECIMAL, or B/INARY.
 
.*K* ALL
   ALL:        AL/L
 
Displays the header of the current granule, the FIT codes array, and all the
codes.
 
.*K* HEADER H
HEADER:     [DI/SPLAY] H/EADER
 
Displays the header of the current granule.  Current granule may be changed by
using the FLINK, BLINK, and DA commands.
 
.*K* FLINK FL
FLINK:      FL/INK
 
Changes the current granule to the granule specified by the Forward Link.
 
.*K* BLINK BL
BLINK:      BL/INK
 
Changes the current granule to the granule specified by the Backward Link.
 
.*K* DA
DA:         DA gnum
 
Disk Address changes the current granule to that specified by gnum.  gnum is
the granule number. It can be a decimal or octal number.  If octal a period (.)
must preceed the number.
 
.*K* DUMP
DUMP:       DU/MP [n]
 
This option will dump the contents of the current granule.  If n is specified,
n number of words will be dumped.
 
.*K* END QUIT XIT
END:       E/ND X/IT Q/UIT
 
Returns to IBEX.
 
.*K* RESTRICTIONS PRIVS
In order to be able to display all of the possible information in the FIT,
FMSEC privilege is needed.  If the user doesn't have FMSEC privilege, the FLINK
and BLINK commands may not be used before issuing a DA command, as the granule
header isn't returned with the FIT.  In addition, when examining a compressed
file, only the FIT may be displayed.
