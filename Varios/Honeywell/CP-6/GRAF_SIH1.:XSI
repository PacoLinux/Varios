GRAF.X
 
.*R*
This rununit contains an automatically starting APL workspace which will
produce a number of different kinds of graphs using the APL/DIGS interface.
Graphic output is produced by entering the data and optional labeling
information and issuing a command for the style of graph to be created and
optionally the destination.
 
This application complements the GRAFA?.X utilities.  Use of GRAF.X requires
both APL and APL/DIGS.
 
.*B*
General Information
 
This application is capable of producing six different kinds of graphs.  These
are: Bar charts, 3D Bar charts, Pie charts, Step charts, Line charts and Plots.
By default all output is directed to the terminal although every command that
generates graphics output optionally permits a destination fid to be specified.
 
Commands accepted by this tool are divided into five major classes.  The
command classes are:  Graphical Output Commands, Labelling Commands, Graphic
Option Commands, and Session Control Commands.  For information on the use of
any of these commands, enter:  HELP commandname.  HELP COMMANDS will report a
summary of the commands available by category.  HELP command-name will describe
how to use a particular command.  HELP EXAMPLE will provide an example of use
of many of the commands.
 
.*K* COMMANDS
Commands are entered when GRAF prompts with a :.  A command may be continued by
terminating the input line with a ;.  Any text within double quotes is treated
as a comment, and all comments must have a terminating ".  Commands are case
insensitive and may be abrieviated.  GRAF supplies the following commands:

.*K* BAR
Syntax:
 
:BAR [OVER fid]
 
This command causes the data entered via the DATA command to be graphically
dislayed in the form of a BAR chart.  The data must have each data point
entered labeled with an X-axis name.  The Y-axis indicates the magnitude of the
values and the X-axis is labelled with the names associated with the data
points.  More than one set of data may be included in the bar chart, although
each set must use the same labels and have been entered in the same order.
 
The STACK option may be used if more than one set of data is included.  In this
case, the values of each X-coordinate position will be stacked upon producing a
single bar for each X-position.
 
The PERCENTAGES option may be used to cause the Y-axis to be labeled in percent
of the total for each point instead of using the Y values for the Y-axis label.
 
The FILL command is used to select the pattern used to fill the interior of
each BAR.  Each set of data is filled with a single interior style.  If more
than one color is available all of the colors are used with first fill pattern
before the next fill pattern is selected.

.*K* BAR3D 3DBAR
Syntax:
 
:BAR3D  [ (angle,elevation) ]  [OVER fid]
 
Parameters:
 
angle      is the X-Y viewing angle.  The specified angle must be in the range
5 through 85 degrees.  An angle of 5 degrees would be viewing the X-axis
(almost) straight on whereas an angle of 85 would be viewing the Y-axis
(almost) straight on.
 
elevation     is the X-Z viewing angle.  The specified angle must be in the
range 5 through 85 degrees.  An angle of 5 degrees would be viewing from the
level of the X-axis, whereas an angle of 85 degrees would be viewing from
(almost) directly above.
 
Description:
 
This command causes the data entered via the DATA command to be graphically
displayed in the form of a 3 dimensional BAR chart.  When the data was entered,
each datapoint must have been labelled (with an X-axis name).  The Y-axis
contains the subtitle given to this set of data and the Z-axis indicates the
magnitude of the value.  More than one set of data may be included in the 3D
bar chart although each set of data must use the same labels and have been
entered in the same order.  Each set of data appears as a row of bars.
 
The HIDE option is used to control whether hidden lines are removed from the 3D
BAR.  The 3D BAR chart is created in an order such that hidden lines will be
automatically removed when displayed on many devices (temporal priority hidden
surface removal).  If the lines are not removed on the device on which this
chart will be displayed, this command will cause the lines to be removed but at
the cost of much additional execution time.
 
The default viewing angle is (45,45).

.*K* LINE
Syntax:
 
:LINE [OVER fid]
 
This command causes the data entered via the DATA command to be graphically
dislayed in the form of a LINE chart.  The data must have each data point
entered labeled with an X-axis name.  The Y-axis indicates the magnitude of the
values and the X-axis is labelled with the names associated with the data
points.  More than one set of data may be included in the line chart, although
each set must use the same labels and have been entered in the same order.
 
If more than one set of data is being displayed, the SUBTITLE specified for the
DATA entered will be used to label the legend.  If the FILL option is
specified, every datapoint will have a marker placed on it.
 
The STACK option is used to display the total of multiple sets of data and see
the effect that each set makes in the total.
 
The PERCENTAGES option is ignored when preparing this graph.

.*K* STEP
Syntax:
 
:STEP [OVER fid]
 
This command causes the data entered via the DATA command to be graphically
dislayed in the form of a STEP chart.  The data must have each data point
entered labeled with an X-axis name.  The Y-axis indicates the magnitude of the
values and the X-axis is labelled with the names associated with the data
points.  More than one set of data may be included in the step chart, although
each set must use the same labels and have been entered in the same order.
 
If more than one set of data is being displayed, the SUBTITLE specified for the
DATA entered will be used to label the legend.  If the FILL option is
specified, every datapoint will have a marker placed on it.
 
The STACK option is used to display the total of multiple sets of data and see

.*K* PIE
Syntax:
 
:PIE  [OVER fid]
 
This command causes the data entered via the DATA command to be graphically
dislayed in the form of a PIE chart.  The data must have each data point
entered labeled with an X-axis name.  The Y-axis indicates the magnitude of the
values and the X-axis is labelled with the names associated with the data
points.  Up to two sets of data may be included in the pie chart,
 
If more than one set of data is being displayed, the SUBTITLE specified for the
DATA entered will be used to label the pie charts.  If the FILL option is
specified, each pie slice will be filled with a different color (if sufficient
colors are available or with different shading patterns).  The FILL patterns
specified by the fill command are used cyclically.
 
If the first character of a data point name is '*', the slice associated with
that point will be slightly removed and the initial '*' will not be displayed.
If the PERCENTAGES option is specified, the name of the slice will be followed
by the percentage of the pie associated with that slice.
 
The GRID, XNAME and YNAME options are not used when producing a PIE chart.

.*K* PLOT
Syntax:
 
:PLOT [OVER fid]
 
This command causes the data entered via the DATA command to be graphically
dislayed in the form of a graph of X-Y values.  The data must have been entered
in X,Y pairs.  More than one set of data points may be included in a graph and
the SUBTITLE entered with the set of data is used to label the graph type on
the legend.  The grid option is used to draw lines from the labeled axis
positions across the entire graph.
 
If more than one set of data is being displayed, the SUBTITLE specified for the
DATA entered will be used to label the legend.  If the FILL option is
specified, every datapoint will have a marker placed on it.
 
The PERCENTAGES option is ignored when preparing this graph.

        [(value,value,value,...,value)            ]
DATA =  [(name=value,name=value,...,name=value)   ]
        [READ(subtitle(fid,type,fmt,fmt,fmt),...) ]
 
.*
.fin
.*R*
Parameters:
 
value      is a number.
 
name       is the name to be associated with a data point.
 
subtitle     is the subtitle to be associated with a set of data points.
 
type       indicates the type of data in the specified file, The type must be
one of the following letters: I (integer sbin(36)), F (floating point REAL*4 or
REAL*8) or A (alphanumeric display form).
 
fid        is a full CP-6 file identifier.
 
fmt        is a collection of format specifications which indicate data D (of
type I, F or A), skipped fields X, or labelling A.  The fmt code may be
followed by a number which indicates the number of characters of data to accept
(or skip) for the specification.
 
.*B*
 
Description:
 
This command is used to enter data to be displayed.  The data may be in the
command input stream, or it may come from a CP-6 file.  The form of input
command used depends upon the type of graphical output being generated.  For
BAR, PIE, LINE and STEP graphs, each value input requires a dataname to be
associated with it and therefore the second or third syntax forms must be used
to enter data for these graphs.  The first syntax form is used to enter data
for PLOT graphics.
 
The last syntax form permits a file to be read and includes a format
specification.  This syntax form may be used to input data for any of the graph
types.
 
.*B* EXAMPLE
 
:DATA ( 1 1  1 2  1.5 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 )
 
This example inputs 6 data points that may be used to generate a PLOT.
 
:DATA (JAN=234,FEB=453,MAR=432,APR=321,MAY=435,JUNE=542)
 
This example inputs 6 data values and associates six labels with those values.
The data labels will be used to label the X-axis if a BAR, LINE or STEP graph
is produced.  The data labels will be used to label the pie slices if a PIE
chart is produced.  A subtitle may be associated with this set of points by
entering a SUBTITLE command after entering this DATA command.
 
.*B*
:DATA READ( Total(LINE0,A,A,D), Blueberry(LINE1,A,A,D) )
 
This example will cause the data to be read from two files (when a graphics
output command is provided).  The data in the files is in alphanumeric form and
contains a label field followed by a data field in each case.  The fields are
separated by either blanks, commas or equals.  The first set of data will be
subtitled 'Total' and the second set of data will be subtitled 'Blueberry'.  If
subtitles contain special characters or embedded blanks, they must be entered
enclosed in quotes.  The input created by this DATA command will be acceptable
to be displayed as a BAR, LINE, STEP or PIE.
 
When a format is specified, the record may be shorter than implied by the
format and the trailing format specifications are ignored.
 
.*B*
:data read( Births(BORN1986.STATLIB,A,A12,D5))
 
This example will cause data to be read from a file called BORN1986.STATLIB.
Each record in the file is in alphanumeric form (A) and contains a 12 character
label field (A12) followed by a 5 character data field (D5).
.*K* COLOR
Syntax:
 
COLOR [ = (colorlist)]
      [ = NO         ]
 
Parameters:
 
colorlist     is a list of color names separated by commas.  The following
color names are available: RED, GREEN, BLUE, WHITE, BLACK, YELLOW, MAGENTA,
CYAN, ORANGE, BROWN, PURPLE, DRKGREEN, LTBLUE, GRAY, and PINK.
 
Description:
 
If no parameters are present, the following colors are selected:
(BLACK,WHITE,RED,GREEN,YELLOW,BLUE,MAGENTA,CYAN).
 
The first color selected will become the background color, the second color
specified will be used to label the graph.  The remaining colors are used in
displaying the data associated with the graph.
 
If the PIE command is issued and a FILL command has been issued, each slice
will appear in a different color (until all colors have been used, then
different fill patterns will be used).
 
For PLOT, LINE and STEP graphs, each data line will be displayed in a different
color.  If a FILL command has been issued, each point will be marked by a
marker in the current color.
 
For BAR charts, the bars associated with each set of data will be filled with
different colors.
 
If the NO option is provided, all graphics output will appear in the same
color.
.*K* STATUS
Syntax:
 
:STATUS
 
Description:
 
This command may be used to display the current graphics options (or context).
The RESET command may be used to set all graphics options to their defaults.
The output of the status command contains all of the commands that would need
to be issued to obtain the current graphics options.

.*K* FILL
Syntax:
 
:FILL  [ = (patternlist)  [n] ]
       [ = NO                 ]
 
Parameters:
 
patternlist     is a list of pattern names separated by commas. The following
pattern names are available: SOLID, VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL, CROSS, SLASH,
BACKSLASH, XCROSS and CLEAR.  A pattern name may also be the name of a file
which contains a definition of the pattern in terms of a PIXEL array.
 
n       is an optional integer value which indicates the line separation to be
used when using one of the provided fill patterns.  The default value is 200.
 
Description:
 
If no parameters are present, then one of two fill patterns will be selected
depending upon whether the colors are being used.  If there is no COLOR, the
defaults are:  (CROSS,XCROSS,SLASH,HORIZONTAL,BACKSLASH,VERTICAL,CLEAR).  If
COLOR is being used, the defaults are:
(SOLID,CROSS,XCROSS,SLASH,HORIZONTAL,BACKSLASH,VERTICAL).
 
The patterns specified (or defaulted) are used sequentially when a new fill
pattern is required.  For example, if a PIE command is issued the first fill
pattern will be used for each of the current colors, then the next fill pattern
will be used with each of the current colors.
 
The NO option is used to reset the filling pattern to the defaults.
 
The FILL option is used by the PIE and BAR commands.
 
If any of the specified fill patterns is not in the list of known fill
patterns, then it must the be name of a file.  The first record of the file
must contain all of the characters that are being used to generate the PIXEL
array fill pattern.  (If COLOR is not specified, only two characters may appear
in the file).  The first character is the background color, the second
character is the second color, the third character the third color.  The
remaining lines of the PIXEL definition are the pattern.  A maximum of 100
lines of 100 characters may be specified for the fill pattern.

.*K* STYLE LINESTYLE
Syntax:
:STYLE = (style-list)
 
Parameters:
 
style-list    is a list of line styles separated by commas.  The
basic line styles are: SOLID, DOT, SDASH, DASH, MDASH and LDASH.
The space between dots or dashes may be increased by ending the
style with a number in the range 1-4 such as: DASH1 or DOT4.
Combinations of DOTs and DASHes are available such as: DASH-DOT
or LDASH-DASH.
 
Description:
 
If no parameters are present, then a single line style of SOLID
is selected.  Otherwise, each set of data graphed by a LINE, STEP
or PLOT command cycles through the list of line-styles starting
with the first line style.

.*K* HIDE HIDDEN_SURFACE
Syntax:
 
HIDE  [ = {YES/NO} ]
 
Description:
 
This command is used to cause the BAR3D graph to remove all hidden lines from
its output.  Many devices obtain acceptable results without removing hidden
lines and hidden line removal is very time consuming.  The default is NO
(hidden lines are not removed).
.*K* SAVE
Syntax:
 
SAVE name[.acct]
 
Parameters:
 
name     is the name of the saved graph context.
 
acct     is the account in which the graph context is to be saved.
 
Description:
 
The current settings of all of the graph variables are written to the file
:GRAF in the specified account and may be referenced by the name specified.
 
Example:
 
.*

Parameters:
 
name     is the name of the graph context to restore.
 
acct     is the account in which the graph context is to be found.
 
Description:
 
The current settings of all of the graph context variables are restored from
the specified context name in the file :GRAF in the specified account.
 
Example:

.*K* FORM
Syntax:
 
:FORM
 
Description:
 
This command is used to display the current graphics context in a form which
allows fields (or context variables) to be updated simply by moving to the
specified field and entering the new value.  All of the graphics context with
the exception of the data may be modified in this mode.
 
Moving to the next field is done by typing a TAB (or Control-I), moving to a
previous field is done by typing a Backspace when positioned at the first
character of a field.
 
The form contains the following fields: TITLE, XNAME, YNAME, NOTE, four
subtitle fields, option indicators for: BORDER, FRAME, GRID, STACK, PERCENTAGES
and HIDE; and settings for FILL, COLOR and STYLE.  The last line of the form
contains an error message line which is used to indicate when an entry error
has occured.  The entry must be corrected before any other commands will be
executed.  The first line of the form contains a command field which is used to
enter a command to produce graphics output or leave FORMs mode.
