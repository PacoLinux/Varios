\label{porting} Vector Pascal is an open-source project. It aims
to create a productive an efficient program development environment
for SIMD programming. In order to validate the concepts it has been
developed initially for the Intel family of processors running Linux
and Microsoft Windows. However it has been intended from the outset
that the technology should be portable to other families of CPUs.
This chapter addresses some of the issues involved in porting the
compiler to new systems.


\section{Dependencies}

The Vector Pascal compiler tool-set can be divided along two axes
as shown in figure \ref{toolset}. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Tools can be divided into (a) those provided as part of the release
, versus (b) tools provided as part of the operating environment. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item These are mainly written in Java, the exceptions being a small run-time
library in C, a Pascal System unit, and several machine descriptions. 
\item These are all available as standard under Linux, and Windows versions
are freely downloadable from the web. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Tools can further divided into (a) those required for program preparation
and documentation, (b) code translation tools, and (c) code generator
preparation tools. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The program preparation tools are the VIPER IDE described in Chapter
\ref{vipintro}, along with the standard \LaTeX{}document prepartion
system, DVI viewers, and the TTH tool to prepare web enabled versions
of Vector Pascal program descriptions. 
\item The program translation tools are: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \texttt{ilcg.pascal} Java package which contains the Pascal compiler
itself and classes to support Pascal type declarations. This carries
out the first stage of code translation, from Pascal to an ILCG tree\cite{Cockshott00}. 
\item A set of machine generated code generators for CPUs such as the Pentium,
the K6 etc. These carry out the second phase of code translation -
into an assembler file. 
\item The \texttt{ilcg.tree} Java package which supports the internal representation
of ILCG trees (see section \ref{ilcgintro}). 
\item The Java system which is need to run all of the above. 
\item An assembler, which is necessary to carry out the third phase of code
translation, from an assembler file to a relocatable object file. 
\item A C compiler and linkage system is needed to compile the C run-time
library and to link the relocatable object files into final executables. 
\item In addition if one wants to alter the reserved words of Vector Pascal
or make other lexical changes one needs the JLex lexical analyser
generator.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Compiler Structure}

%
\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[  width=3.5in]{system}


\caption{The translation of Vector Pascal to assembler.\label{fig:system}}
\end{figure}
 The structure of the Vector Pascal translation system is shown in
figure \ref{fig:system}. The main program class of the compiler \texttt{ilcg.Pascal.PascalCompiler.java}
translates the source code of the program into an internal structure
called an ILCG tree \cite{Cockshott00}. A machine generated code
generator then translates this into assembler code. An example would
be the class ilcg.tree.IA32. An assembler and linker specified in
descendent class of the code generator then translate the assembler
code into an executable file.

Consider first the path followed from a source file, the phases that
it goes through are 

\begin{itemize}
\item i. The source file (1) is parsed by a java class PascalCompiler.class
(2) a hand written, recursive descent parser\cite{Watt}, and results
in a Java data structure (3), an ILCG tree, which is basically a semantic
tree for the program. 
\item ii. The resulting tree is transformed (4) from sequential to parallel
form and machine independent optimisations are performed. Since ILCG
trees are java objects, they can contain methods to self-optimise.
Each class contains for instance a method \texttt{eval} which attempts
to evaluate a tree at compile time. Another method \texttt{simplify}
applies generic machine independent transpormations to the code. Thus
the \texttt{simplify} method of the class \texttt{For} can perform
loop unrolling, removal of redundant loops etc. Other methods allow
tree walkers to apply context specific transformations. 
\item iii. The resulting ilcg tree (7) is walked over by a class that encapsulates
the semantics of the target machine's instructionset (10); for example
Pentium.class. During code generation the tree is futher transformed,
as machine specific register optimisations are performed. The output
of this process is an assembler file (11). 
\item iv. This is then fed through an appropriate assembler and linker,
assumed to be externally provided to generate an executable program. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vectorisation}

The parser initially generates serial code for all constructs. It
then interogates the current code generator class to determine the
degree of parallelism possible for the types of operations performed
in a loop, and if these are greater than one, it vectorises the code.

Given the declaration

\textbf{var v1,v2,v3:array{[}1..9{]} of integer;}

then the statement

\textbf{v1:=v2+v3;}

would first be translated to the ILCG sequence shown in figure \ref{seqf}%
\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
{ var  i;
  for  i=1 to 9 step 1 do {
   v1[^i]:= +(^(v2[^i]),^(v3[^i]));
  };
}
\end{verbatim}


\caption{Sequential form of array assignment}

\label{seqf}
\end{figure}
 In the example above variable names such as \texttt{v1} and \texttt{i}
have been used for clarity. In reality \texttt{i} would be an addressing
expression like:

\verb{ (ref int32)mem(+(^((ref int32)ebp),     -1860)){,

which encodes both the type and the address of the variable. The code
generator is queried as to the parallelism available on the type \texttt{int32}
and, since it is a Pentium with MMX, returns 2. The loop is then split
into two, a portion that can be executed in parallel and a residual
sequential component, resulting in the ILCG shown in figure \ref{parf}.%
\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
{ var i;  
   for i=    1 to     8 step     2 do {
    (ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v1,*(-(^i,1),4))):=
       +(^((ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v2,*(-(^i,1),4)))), 
         ^((ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v3,*(-(^i,1),4)))));
   };
   for i=    9 to     9 step     1 do {
      v1[^i]:= +(^(v2[^i]),^(v3[^i]));
   };
}
\end{verbatim}


\caption{Parallelised loop}

\label{parf}
\end{figure}
 In the parallel part of the code, the array subscriptions have been
replaced by explictly cast memory addresses. This coerces the locations
from their original types to the type required by the vectorisation.
Applying the \texttt{simplify}  method of the For class the following
generic transformations are performed: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The second loop is replaced by a single statement. 
\item The parallel loop is unrolled twofold. 
\item The For class is replaced by a sequence of statements with explicit
gotos. 
\end{enumerate}
The result is shown in figure \ref{simpf}. When the \texttt{eval}
method is invoked, constant folding causes the loop test condition
to be evaluated to

\verb{if >(^i,8) thengoto leb4af11b47f{. %
\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
{ var i:
  i:= 1;
  leb4af11b47e:
  if >( 2, 0) thenif >(^i,8) thengoto leb4af11b47f
                else null
                        fi
         else if <(^i, 8) thengoto leb4af11b47f
         else null
         fi
  fi;
 (ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v1,*(-(^i,1),4))):=
       +(^((ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v2,*(-(^i,1),4)))), 
         ^((ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v3,*(-(^i,1),4)))));
  i:=+(^i,2);
 (ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v1,*(-(^i,1),4))):=
       +(^((ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v2,*(-(^i,1),4)))), 
         ^((ref int32 vector ( 2 ))mem(+(@v3,*(-(^i,1),4)))));
  i:=+(^i,2);
  goto leb4af11b47e;
  leb4af11b47f:
  i:=    9;
  v1[^i]:= +(^(v2[^i]),^(v3[^i]));
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Porting strategy}

To port the compiler to a new machine, say a G5, it is necessary to

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a new machine description \texttt{G5.ilc} in ILCG source code. 
\item Compile this to a code generator in java with the ilcg compiler generator
using a command of the form

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{java ilcg.ILCG cpus/G5.ilc ilcg/tree/G5.java G5}
\end{enumerate}
\item Write an interface class \texttt{ilcg/tree/G5CG} which is a subclass
of \texttt{G5}  and which invokes the assembler and linker. The linker
and assembler used will depend on the machine but one can assume that
at least a \texttt{gcc} assembler and linker will be available. The
class \texttt{G5CG} must take responsibility to handle the translation
of procedure calls from the abstract form provided in ILCG to the
concrete form required by the G5 processor. 
\item The class \texttt{G5CG} should also export the method \texttt{getparallelism}
which specifies to the vectoriser the degree of parallelism available
for given data types. An example for a P4 is given in figure \ref{getparallelism}.
Note that although a P4 is potentially capable of performing 16 way
parallelism on 8 bit operands the measured speed when doing this on
is less than that measured for 8 way parallelism. This is due to the
restriction placed on un-aligned loads of 16 byte quantities in the
P4 architecture. For image processing operations aligned accesses
are the exception. Thus when specifying the degree of parallelism
for a processor one should not simply give the maximal degree supported
by the architecture. The maximal level of parallelism is not necessarily
the fastest. 
\end{enumerate}
%
\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
public int getParallelism(String elementType) 
{   if(elementType.equals(Node.int32)) return 2;
    if(elementType.equals(Node.int16)) return 4;
    if(elementType.equals(Node.int8)) return 8;   
    if(elementType.equals(Node.uint32)) return 2;
    if(elementType.equals(Node.uint16)) return 4;
    if(elementType.equals(Node.uint8)) return 8;  
    if(elementType.equals(Node.ieee32))return 4; 
    if(elementType.equals(Node.ieee64))return 1;  
    return 1; 
} 
\end{verbatim}


\caption{The method getParallelism for a P4 processor. }

\end{figure}
 Sample machine descriptions   are given on the Vector Pascal
web site
  to help those wishing to port the compiler.
These are given in the ILCG machine description language, an outline
of which follows.


\section{ILCG }

\label{ilcgintro} The purpose of ILCG (Intermediate Language for
Code Generation) is to mediate between CPU instruction sets and high
level language programs. It poth provides a representation to which
compilers can translate a variety of source level programming languages
and also a notation for defining the semantics of CPU instructions.

Its purpose is to act as an input to two types of programs: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item ILCG structures produced by a HLL compiler are input to an automatically
constructed code generator, working on the syntax matching principles
described in \cite{graham80}. This then generates equivalent sequences
of assembler statements. 
\item Machine descriptions written as ILCG source files are input to code-generator-generators
which produce java programs which perform function (1) above. 
\end{enumerate}
So far one HLL compiler producing ILCG structures as output exists:
the Vector Pascal compiler. There also exists one code-generator-generator
which produces code generators that use a top-down pattern matching
technique analogous to Prolog unification. ILCG is intended to be
flexible enough to describe a wide variety of machine architectures.
In particular it can specify both SISD and SIMD instructions and either
stack-based or register-based machines. However, it does assume certain
things about the machine: that certain basic types are supported and
that the machine is addressed at the byte level.

In ILCG all type conversions, dereferences etc have to be made absolutely
explicit. In what follows we will designate terminals of the language
in bold thus \textbf{octet} and nonterminal in sloping font thus 
\textsl{word8}. 


\section{Supported types}


\subsection{Data formats}

The data in a memory can be distinguished initially in terms of the
number of bits in the individually addressable chunks. The addressable
chunks are assumed to be the powers of two from 3 to 7, so we thus
have as allowed formats:\textsl{word8, word16, word32, word64, word128}.
These are treated as non terminals in the grammar of ILCG.

When data is being explicitly operated on without regard to its type,
we have terminals which stand for these formats: \textbf{octet, halfword,
word, doubleword, quadword}. 


\subsection{Typed formats}

Each of these underlying formats can contain information of different
types, either signed or unsigned integers, floats etc. ILCG allows
the following integer types as terminals :\textbf{int8, uint8, int16,
uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64} to stand for signed and unsigned
integers of the appropriate lengths.

The integers are logically grouped into \textsl{signed} and \textsl{unsigned}.
As non-terminal types they are represented as \textsl{byte, short,
integer, long} and \textsl{ubyte, ushort, uinteger, ulong}.

Floating point numbers are either assumed to be 32 bit or 64 bit with
32 bit numbers given the nonterminal symbols \textsl{float,double}.
If we wish to specify a particular representation of floats of doubles
we can use the terminals \textbf{ieee32, ieee64}.


\subsection{Ref types}

ILCG uses a simplified version of the Algol-68 reference typing model.
A value can be a reference to another type. Thus an integer when used
as an address of a 64 bit floating point number would be a \textbf{ref
ieee64} . Ref types include registers. An integer register would be
a \textbf{ref int32} when holding an integer, a \textbf{ref ref int32}
when holding the address of an integer etc. 


\section{Supported operations}


\subsection{Type casts}

The syntax for the type casts is C style so we have for example \texttt{(ieee32)
int32} to represent a desire to treat a 32 bit integer as a 32 bit
real. These type casts act only as constraints on the pattern matcher during
code generation. They do not indicate that the underlying hardware will perform any data transformation. They
are inserted into machine descritions to constrain the types of the
arguments that will be matched for an instruction. They are also used
by compilers to decorate ILCG trees in order both to enforce, and
to allow limited breaking of, the type rules.


\subsection{Arithmetic}

The allowed dyadic arithmetic operations are addition, saturated addition,
multiplication, saturated multiplication, subtraction, saturated subtraction,
division and remainder with operator symboles \textbf{+, +:, {*},
{*}:, -, -:, div , mod}..
 \begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Name & syntax & num args& comment\\ 
plus & '+'&&\\
 satplus & '+:'&&\\
 satminus & '-:'&&\\
 satmult &'*:'&&\\
 
 equals & '='&&\\
 le & '<='&&\\
 ge&'>='&&\\
 ne&'<>'&&\\
 shl&'<<'&&\\
 shr&'>>'&&\\

 and & 'AND'&&\\
 or & 'OR' &&\\
 xor & 'XOR'&&\\
 not & 'NOT'&&\\
 sin&'SIN'&&\\
 cos&'COS'&&\\
 abs&'ABS'&&\\
 tan&'TAN'&&\\
 ln&'LN'&&\\
 min&'MIN'&&\\
 max&'MAX'&&\\
 sqrt&'SQRT'&&\\
 trunc&'TRUNCATE'&&\\

 float&'FLOAT'&&\\

 deref & '\^'&&\\
 push &'PUSH'&&\\
 pop &'POP'&&\\
 
\end{tabular}
\caption{The prefix operations of ILCG}
\label{tab:}
\end{table}

The concrete syntax is prefix with bracketing. Thus the infix operation
$3+5\div 7$ would be represented as \textbf{+(3 div (5 7))}. 


\subsection{Memory}

Memory is explicitly represented. All accesses to memory are represented
by array operations on a predefined array \textbf{mem}. Thus location
100 in memory is represented as \textbf{mem(100)}. The type of such
an expression is \textsl{address}. It can be cast to a reference type
of a given format. Thus we could have \textbf{(ref int32)mem(100) }


\subsection{Assignment }

We have a set of storage operators corresponding to the word lengths
supported. These have the form of infix operators. The size of the
store being performed depends on the size of the right hand side.
A valid storage statement might be \textbf{(ref octet)mem( 299) :=(int8)
99}

The first argument is always a reference and the second argument a
value of the appropriate format.

If the left hand side is a format the right hand side must be a value
of the appropriate size. If the left hand side is an explicit type
rather than a format, the right hand side must have the same type. 


\subsection{Dereferencing}

Dereferencing is done explicitly when a value other than a literal
is required. There is a dereference operator, which converts a reference
into the value that it references. A valid load expression might be:
\textbf{(octet)$\uparrow $ ( (ref octet)mem(99))}

The argument to the load operator must be a reference.


\section{Machine description}

Ilcg can be used to describe the semantics of machine instructions.
A machine description typically consists of a set of register declarations
followed by a set of instruction formats and a set of operations.
This approach works well only with machines that have an orthogonal
instruction set, ie, those that allow addressing modes and operators
to be combined in an independent manner. 


\subsection{Registers }

When entering machine descriptions in ilcg registers can be declared
along with their type hence \textbf{register word EBX assembles{[}'ebx'{]}
;}

\textbf{reserved register word ESP assembles{[}'esp'{]};}

would declare \textbf{EBX} to be of type \textbf{ref word}.


\subsubsection{Aliasing}

A register can be declared to be a sub-field of another register,
hence we could write  \textbf{alias register octet AL = EAX(0:7) assembles{[}'al'{]};}

\textbf{alias register octet BL = EBX(0:7) assembles{[}'bl'{]};}

to indicate that \textbf{BL} occupies the bottom 8 bits of register
\textbf{EBX}. In this notation bit zero is taken to be the least significant
bit of a value. There are assumed to be two pregiven registers \textbf{FP,
GP} that are used by compilers to point to areas of memory. These
can be aliased to a particular real register.\textbf{register word
EBP assembles{[}'ebp'{]} ;}

\textbf{alias register word FP = EBP(0:31) assembles {[}'ebp'{]};}

Additional registers may be reserved, indicating that the code generator
must not use them to hold temporary values:

\textbf{reserved register word ESP assembles{[}'esp'{]}; }


\subsection{Register sets}

A set of registers that are used in the same way by the instructionset
can be defined. \textbf{pattern reg means {[}$EBP|EBX|ESI|EDI|ECX|EAX|EDX|ESP${]}
;}

\textbf{pattern breg means{[}$AL|AH|BL|BH|CL|CH|DL|DH${]}; }

All registers in an register set should be of the same length.


\subsection{Register Arrays}

Some machine designs have regular arrays of registers. Rather than
have these exhaustively enumerated it is convenient to have a means
of providing an array of registers. This can be declared as:

\textbf{register vector(8)doubleword MM assembles{[}'MM'i{]} ;}

This declares the symbol MMX to stand for the entire MMX register
set. It implicitly defines how the register names are to be printed
in the assembly language by defining an indexing variable i that is
used in the assembly language definition.

We also need a syntax for explicitly identifying individual registers
in the set. This is done by using the dyadic subscript operator: \textbf{subscript(MM,2)}

which would be of type \textbf{ref doubleword}. 


\subsection{Register Stacks}

Whilst some machines have registers organised as an array, another
class of machines, those oriented around postfix instructionsets,
have register stacks.

The ilcg syntax allows register stacks to be declared:

\textbf{register stack (8)ieee64 FP assembles{[} ' '{]} ;}

Two access operations are supported on stacks: 


\paragraph{PUSH}

is a void dyadic operator taking a stack of type ref $t$ as first
argument and a value of type $t$ as the second argument. Thus we
might have:  \textbf{PUSH(FP,$\uparrow $mem(20)) }


\paragraph{POP}

is a monadic operator returning $t$ on stacks of type $t$. So we
might have \textbf{mem(20):=POP(FP)}  In addition there are two predicates
on stacks that can be used in pattern pre-conditions. 


\paragraph{FULL}

is a monadic boolean operator on stacks. 


\paragraph{EMPTY}

is a monadic boolean operator on stacks. 


\subsection{Instruction formats}

An instruction format is an abstraction over a class of concrete instructions.
It abstracts over particular operations and types thereof whilst specifying
how arguments can be combined. \textbf{instruction pattern}

\textbf{RR( operator op, anyreg r1, anyreg r2, int t)}

\textbf{means{[}r1:=(t) op( $\uparrow $((ref t) r1),$\uparrow $((ref
t) r2)){]}}

\textbf{assembles{[}op ' ' r1 ',' r2{]};}

In the above example, we specify a register to register instruction
format that uses the first register as a source and a destination
whilst the second register is only a destination. The result is returned
in register r1.

We might however wish to have a more powerful abstraction, which was
capable of taking more abstract apecifications for its arguments.
For example, many machines allow arguments to instructions to be addressing
modes that can be either registers or memory references. For us to
be able to specify this in an instruction format we need to be able
to provide grammer non-terminals as arguments to the instruction formats.

For example we might want to be able to say

\textbf{instruction pattern}

\textbf{RRM(operator op, reg r1, maddrmode rm, int t)}

\textbf{means {[}r1:=(t) op( $\uparrow $((ref t)r1),$\uparrow $((ref
t) rm)){]}}

\textbf{assembles{[}op ' ' r1 ',' rm {]} ;}

This implies that addrmode and reg must be non terminals. Since the
non terminals required by different machines will vary, there must
be a means of declaring such non-terminals in ilcg.

An example would be:   \textbf{pattern regindirf(reg r)}

\textbf{means{[}$\uparrow $(r) {]} assembles{[} r {]};}

\textbf{pattern baseplusoffsetf(reg r, signed s)}

\textbf{means{[}+( $\uparrow $(r) ,const s){]} assembles{[} r '+'
s {]};}

\textbf{pattern addrform means{[}baseplusoffsetf$|$ regindirf{]};}

\textbf{pattern maddrmode(addrform f)}

\textbf{means{[}mem(f) {]} assembles{[} '{[}' f '{]}' {]};}

This gives us a way of including non terminals as parameters to patterns.


\section{Grammar of ILCG}

The following grammar is given in Sable \cite{sable} compatible form.
The Sable parser generator is used to generate a parser for ILCG from
this grammar. The ILCG parser then translates a CPU specification
into a tree structure which is then walked by an ILCG-tree-walk-generator
to produce an ILCG-tree-walk Java class specific to that CPU.

If the ILCG grammar is extended, for example to allow new arithmetic
operators, then the ILCG-tree-walk-generator must itself be modified
to generate translation rules for the new operators.
