Relase notes on the Unicode compatibility library for Pascal

This directory contains the run time libraries and 
lexer files required to configure a Pascal compiler
to accept utf8 unicode input, with the 
Chinese equivalents of the pascal reserved words
encoded in unicode.

rtl.c  A basic run time library for pascal in c that does
       i/o on the assumption that the type char is a 16
       bit unsigned short and that all reading and writing
       to text files should be in utf-8 format.

macros.asm Some assembler macros that are used both by
       the ilcp code generators and which provide a 
       couple of optimised string handling routines
       in assembler


paslexer.c c output file of the bumblebee parser 
           generator from input file paslex.l

paslexer.h header file generated by bumblebee parser 
           generator

paslexer.l source file for the lexical analyser to be read
           in by the bumblebee parser generator

 
pasrev.h header file defining extended set of pascal reserved
         words

lexical_test_unicode.txt various sample unicode files these can
                         be viewed using visual studio .net or
                         by importing them into Word as utf or
                         unicode files
lexical_test_utf8.txt
output.txt
testout.txt
utf16.txt
utf8.txt
utf8output.txt


manual.pdf  Copy of the vector pascal manual which specifies
            how the unicode characterset has been integrated
            into vector pascal as an example.
