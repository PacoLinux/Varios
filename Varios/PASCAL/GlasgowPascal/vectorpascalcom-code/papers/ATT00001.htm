I'll be in the lab in half an hour if you'd like to meet then. It was my birthday yesterday, and I was not in a state to be in any earlier, I am afraid.<br>

Tamerlan, here is an email I got this morning, it seems sensible.<br>
I am in invigilating an exam and could see you in the lab 11 to 12 if you are in.<br>

I have a suggestion for the website, if Tamerlan is still working on it. It is to add two more equilibrium rates:<br>
<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With growth of workforce set to zero.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With both growth of workforce and productivity set to zero.<br>
<br>
<br>
That way one can isolate the effects of both variables. It is illustrated in my original paper.<br>
