This makes the code more generic and understandable to non-pascal programmers.        It also makes the code (usually) a lot more comprehendable then the pascal code.</P><P align=left>Computer programs are mathematical by their very nature,        but mathematical notation is hard to input through the keyboard (and other available devices).        Horizontal fraction-delimiters, square-roots and sub/superscripts are but a few examples of this.</P><P align=left>VpMath translates valid Vector Pascal code (backwards compatible with Extended Pascal) into mathematical notation.        <b>To turn VPMath on:</b> In the menu choose "TeX",  "VPTeX-Options".        Then make sure "Use math converter" is selected.</P><P align=left><H3>The mathematical representation(not required reading):</H3>Note: The quality of these illustrations is not comparable to the actual output.</P><P align=left>Operators are (where available) converted to the conventional mathematical (Latex) symbol.        Fractions that are not themselves nested within mathematical structures are changed to fractional symbols.        Powers are represented as superscripts.        The following are examples of mathematically converted arithmetic operations.<br>        <img src="Operations.gif"><br></P><P align=left>A lot of array operations map naturally to mathematical notation.        Exampes (as follows) are array indexing/slicing, reduction operations and permutations.<br>        <img src="Arrays.gif"><br></P><P align=left>A lot of reserved functions have a standard representation in Latex.        This includes trigonometric operators, square-root and many others,        which are translated to a latex-symbol when available.        As an extra facility to the trigonometry, the English names of Greek letters (except iota)        are translated into the actual Greek letters.<br>        <img src="Functions.gif"><br></P><P align=left>Declarations look slightly neater with the following notation.        The readability isn't greatly enhanced,        but the change is consistent with the maths conversion of the rest of the file.        <img src="Declarations.gif"><br></P><P align=left><A href="./intro.htm">Backto Menu</A></P></BODY></HTML>
