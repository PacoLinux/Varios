<P align=left>The editor supports features such as 
Colour Syntaxing, bracket matching, and a line number gutter.</P>
<P align=left>Most of its features are obvious, it supports 
cut,copy,paste,undo,redo as expected, however a few of the less obvious features 
of the editor are described below.</P>
<P align=left>The colour syntaxing routine in VIPER supports Vector Pascal HTML and LaTeX files.</P>
<P align=left>The Editor window will appear in the top right side of the main VIPER 
window, and takes up most of the workspace. In order to enter text into a 
window, you either need to create a new document or open an existing document. 
Colour syntaxing will automatically be added to a document, once its type has 
been established.</P>
<P align=left>If you open more than one document, then they are displayed using 
a tabbedpane method, just click on the tab to display the required document.</P>
<P align=left>If you alter any documents and try to close them without saving 
them, then you will be warned to save before you close.</P>
<P align=left>A useful feature of the VIPER editor is the bracket matching. To use this 
feature just place the editing caret/cursor behind the bracket that you want to 
match. A black box will then hilight the matching bracket that you selected.</P>
<P align=left>The line gutter, function allows you to see what line numbers your 
code is on. This gutter will also function as a visible way to set breakpoints 
for debugging purposes.<BR>The gutter is set to be hidden as default, if you 
which to display it, there is a thin black vertical line at the left side of the 
editor window. Double click on this to show or hide the gutter.</P>
<P align=left>To close a window, make sure that it is the current document, and 
then select close from the window menu.<BR>From the window menu, you can also 
display a window by clicking on its name, or close all documents.</P>
<P align=left>Another useful feature is that you can right click on the editor 
window to display a popup menu of the most commonly used actions that you will 
need to use.</P>
