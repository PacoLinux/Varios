﻿\subsection{Extended characterset}
The extended characterset allows the use of the Greek
letters Α-Ω , the Cyrillic letters А-Я with the
corresponding lower case letters Greek and Cyrillic as synonyms,
 Hiragana letters ぁ-ゔ and the
Katakana letters ァ-ヺ. These characters are treated
as additional letters available for the definition of identifiers
in the language.

In addition any Unicode Chinese character can be used
as an identifier.
