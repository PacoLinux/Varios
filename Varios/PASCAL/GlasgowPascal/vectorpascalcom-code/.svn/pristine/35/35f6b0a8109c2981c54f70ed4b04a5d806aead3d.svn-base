\paragraph{Performance on the Dhrystone Benchmark}

For an indicator of the performance of Vector Pascal on other instruction mixes,
the Dhrystone Pascal benchmark was used. This indicates that Vector Pascal is
substantially slower on such instruction mixes than Delphi but considerably
faster than Borland Pascal. All measurements were performed on a 1Ghz Athlon.
One reason why the Delphi compiler is so fast is its use of registers for parameter
passing in procedure calls.
