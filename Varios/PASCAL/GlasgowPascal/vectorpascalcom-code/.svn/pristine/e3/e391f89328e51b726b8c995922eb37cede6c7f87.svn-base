<p align="left">The function finder is displayed in the bottom left part of the main editor
window.</p>

<p align="left">It works by reading the current document, and displaying the
documents functions and procedures in its own window.<br>
If you wanted to find a particular method in the source code, all you would need to do is
click on the relevant method, and it automatically hi-lights the line within your source
code in the editor window.</p>

<p align="left">To force the window to refresh click on the update button -
located at the end of the bottom toolbar. This will refresh the methods window.</p>

<p align="left">It the current document is a LaTeX document (.tex suffix) the funtion finder will find the Chapters, sections, subsections etc of the document, the section finder then behaves in a similar way to the function finder described above.</p>
