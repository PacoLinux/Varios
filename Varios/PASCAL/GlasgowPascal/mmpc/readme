Installation details
 
Dependencies
------------
Java, Nasm, Gcc, M4 macro processor if you are doing source development work.
 

You can install either from source or from the download files install.win32.zip or 
install.linux.tar.gz

If installing from source, you should run the command
make install
to create the installation archives.


On Linux
--------
If you are just running the compiler to compile Pascal source you
need : (Sun's) Java, Nasm and Gcc.
 
GCC is used to build and link runtime libraries to the assembler 
produced by Vector Pascal. On Linux the standard GCC compiler will work. 
 
Extract the mmpc directory from install.tar.gz with the command:
tar -zxvf install.linux.tar.gz

You will now need to build a compatible RTL by doing the following:
Go into the directory mmpc and type
make rtl
and then type
make rtl.o

Optionally, place the directory mmpc on your path with the following command:
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/mmpc
Note that this will have to be set to run every time your computer starts.
 
If you have altered the locations of the installed files from the default, you 
will need to define the symbol mmpcdir to point at the directory containing 
mmpc.jar by running the following command:
export mmpcdir=/path/to/mmpc


On Windows
----------
When working on Windows some incompatibilities exist between different releases
of GCC and of assemblers. The NASM assembler under Windows will only work 
reliably with the djgpp release of GCC and not with Cygwin. Given Cygwin's easy
installation, when working with Windows, the prefered method is to use the 
Cygwin compiler, not the DJGPP compiler.

To install, first obtain a copy of Cygwin from http://cygwin.com/setup.exe
or http://www.cygwin.com/

When installing Cygwin, add the "make" package to the default programs to 
install.

Once Cygwin is installed, extract the VPC archive using the following:
unzip install.win32.zip

You will now need to build a compatible RTL by doing the following:
Go into the directory mmpc and type
make rtl
Then type
make rtl.o

The environment variable "mmpcdir" will have to be set. This can be done by
right clicking on "My Computer" and selecting "Properties". Select the 
"Advanced" tab and clicking on the "Environment Variables" button. mmpcdir
should then be set to the path to the files you extracted earlier.

Additionally, you may choose to add the same directory to your path.

To execute, you can use either Cygwin's shell or a standard Dos prompt.

=================================================================
If you want to use the pretty printer facility built into the compiler, then 
you will need Latex.

If you want to use the garbage collector go into the directory
for the garbage collector mmpc/rtl/gc and follow the instructions
to build the Boehm garbage collection library gc.a
 
then go into mmpc and type
 
make rtlb.o
