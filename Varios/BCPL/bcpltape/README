This is bcpltape.tar as made available by Ken Yap, but with the character
mapping problems corrected, and the files renamed from f01 through
f75 into suitable UNIX names, on the basis of information appearing
in file f01.  The INDEX file shows how the filenames are mapped, and
incorporates comments based on those found in the f01 file.

There are only 55 files.  Those missing have "-" in place of a filename
in the INDEX file.

The README.orig file is Ken Yap's original README.
