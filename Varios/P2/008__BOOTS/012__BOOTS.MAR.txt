	TIMEDWAIT - Timed Wait Loop with Imbedded Tests

Macro to wait for a specified interval of time.Uses a processor
specific value established by system bootstrap to determine an 
approximate interval of time to wait instead of reading the 
processor clock. Instructions that test for various exit conditions
may be imbedded within the wait loop. it so desired.

This version of TIMEDWAIt is set up to be used with boot drivers.
It contains the right kind of PIC references to EXE$GL_TENUSEC and
EXE$GL_USDELAY, for code that is moved within the address space of 
an image at run-time instead of remaining bound to the relative
offset within the image givenit at link-time. (Note that these
two counters are kept in the BQO structure and are referenced via
BQO$L_UBDELAY and BQO$L_TENUSEC.)

INPUTS:

	TIME - the number of 10 micro-second intervals to wait
	INS1 - first instruction to imbed within wait loop
	INS2 - second instruction to imbed within wait loop
	INS3 - third instruction to imbed within wait loop
	INS4 - fourth instruction to imbed within wait loop
	INS5 - fifth instruction to imbed within wait loop
	INS6 - sixth instruction to imbed within wait loop
	DONELBL - label for exit from wait loop
	IMBEDLBL - Label for imbedded instructions in wait loop
	UBLBL - Label for UNIBUS SOBGTR loop

OUTPUTS:

	RO - indicates success of failure status. Success is defined as
		the bit being at the specified sense within the specified 
		time interval

	R1 - destroyed, all other registers preserved.
