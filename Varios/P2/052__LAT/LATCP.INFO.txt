   LATCP allows you to control the LAT software on a node and to
   obtain information from it. For example, you can use LATCP to
   create services on the local node, to associate a port on the
   local node with a service or device on a remote terminal server,
   and to display information about services offered on the local
   node or on other nodes in the network.

   When you use LATCP commands to change LAT characteristics (such
   as creating a service and associating a port with a service),
   the changes take effect immediately. However, when the LAT
   port driver stops, these characteristics are lost. If you want
   these characteristics to be present the next time you start
   the LAT port driver, edit LAT$SYSTARTUP.COM by modifying or
   adding commands to set these characteristics. Then, invoke
   LAT$STARTUP.COM to start the LAT port driver.

   Format

     RUN SYS$SYSTEM:LATCP

   To invoke LATCP, enter RUN SYS$SYSTEM:LATCP at the DCL command
   prompt. At the LATCP> prompt, you can enter any of the LATCP
   commands.

   To exit from LATCP, enter the EXIT command at the LATCP> prompt
   or press Ctrl/Z.

   You can also execute a single LATCP command by using a DCL string
   assignment statement, as shown in the following example:

   $ LCP :== $LATCP
   $ LCP SET NODE/STATE=ON

   LATCP executes the SET NODE command and returns control to DCL.
