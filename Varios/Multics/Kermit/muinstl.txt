                  Installation Instructions for
                           Kermit 2.0g



     Multics Kermit has been packaged  for  distribution  as  two

large  source  files,  kermit.pl1 (mukmt.pl1, the user interface)

and kermit_.pl1 (mukmtp.pl1, the protocol machine).  All  include

files  have been premerged for ease of distribution.  If you want

an archive of the entire source in  the  original  Multics  form,

send a tape directly to me.



     The source files do not contain any control characters other

than  form  feed characters for listing pagination.  There should

be no trouble with  sending  these  files  over  various  network

connections.



     Before  compiling the programs, one or two options should be

set in kermit.pl1.  The  variable  kermit_info_dir  contains  the

path  name  of  the  directory  containing all of the kermit help

files used in the internal help facility.  All help files  should

be  in  this  directory.  It is currently set to >am>KERMIT>info.

This may need to be changed in your installation.  A  listing  of

the  help  files, their names on the tape and their multics names

follows later in this document.  There are also  three  variables

used  to  control  the  builtin  metering facility.  The variable

meter_enable turns metering on if initialized to true and off  if

initialized  to  false.   If  metering  is on, kermit will send a

message to a specified mailbox with  information  on  the  kermit

session.   The  variable  kermit_mbx  contains  the  name  of the

mailbox.  If it is a pathname, kermit_mbx_ctl_arg should have the

value "-pn".  If  it  is  a  Personid.ProjID,  kermit_mbx_ctl_arg

should be a null string.  The message sent contains the following

information:

   # Pkts sent  # Pkts recd  # Retries  # Files sent

      # Files recd  # File Failures  Mode (R=Reg, S=Server)

This message is sent only if file transfer has been attempted.



     Note the default modes string.  Files are transfered through

block transfer with no initial character and a CR terminating the

block.   Raw  output  and no parity are used to allow binary file

transmission.  Echoplex is turned off.   The  force  mode  is  in

effect to allow non-appropriate modes to be ignored.  If for some

reason, the default needs to be changed, it should be done in the

beginning of kermit.pl1 where the info structure is allocated and

initialized.   These  modes have been found to work reliably over

time.  Be sure to test any changes.  Users also have  the  option

of setting the modes kermit will use via the

      set modes <modes_string>

command.   This may also be a command argument (kermit -set modes

<modes_string>).   The  program  assumes  no  responsibility  for

consequences  if  improper  modes  are  employed  so users should

exercise care in this option.  Note that the entire modes  string

is replaced; it is not modified.  The string is checked for valid

modes before it is replaced, however.



     The  info  structure  is  allocated  once  per  process in a

temporary  segment.   All  settings  (except  default  directory)

remain as set throughout the process.



     Compile  the  two  programs  and  bind  them together into a

single object.  The kermit program has  the  entrypoints  kermit,

new_kermit and old_kermit.



     The  following is a list of help files used by this version:



      Multics Name              ANSI TAPE NAME

  ---------------------     ----------------------

  server_online.k.info        musrvn.hlp

  kermit_online.info          mukmt.hlp



  kermit.info                 mugkmt.hlp

  kermit_bugs.info            mukmtb.hlp



     The kermit_online.info segment contains the text for all  of

the    online   help   information.    This   segment   and   the

server_online.k.info segment should reside in the info dir.   The

segment kermit_online.info should have the following addnames:

       set.k.info

       server.k.info

       help.k.info

       exec.k.info

       show.k.info

       status.k.info

       send.k.info

       receive.k.info

       kermit.k.info





     The kermit_bugs file lists those bugs or idiosyncracies that

I am aware of.  I would appreciate it if you would send along any

discrepencies identified by your users.



    Also  included  is  a  help  seg  for  the command level help

command called mugkmt.hlp (kermit.info).  This lists all commands

and options currently  available.   Only  this  segment  and  the

kermit_bugs.info  segment  need to be linked into the system help

directories.



     The last two files on the tape  (mukmt.tre  and  mukmtp.tre)

contain  call trees for kermit and kermit_.  These are short form

call trees that contain the call structure of the program.  These

may be useful for understanding the program structure.



    Comments and critism may be directed to me at the address  at

the  top  of this page.  I may also be reached at (313) 377-4329.

With any luck we will be on MailNet in the not too distant future

and communications will improve.
