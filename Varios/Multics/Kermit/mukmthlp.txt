:Info: set:  Kermit Set Command
Syntax: set <group_name> <parm> <val>
            - or -
        set <parm> <val>

   This command allows the user to set various parameters that determin
   kermit's behavior.  Settings are retained between invocations during
   a process except for the current directory and the setting of the
   trace option which defaults to off.

   The <group_name> may be one of send, receive or rec.  Parameters for
   this syntax take the form:
     PACKET-LENGTH <decimal_number>  Sets packet length
     PADDING <decimal_number>  Sets number of padding characters
     PADCHAR <octal_number>    Set the padding character to <octal_number>
     TIMEOUT <decimal_number>  Sets max time to wait for a packet
     END-OF-LINE <octal_number> End of line character to use on packets
     QUOTE <octal_number>  Sets quote character, send group only.

   The second syntax allows the following:
     DELAY <n>  Sets initial delay to n seconds on send.
     DIR <pathname> Sets current directory to that specified.
     FILE-WARNING, FW {on | off} Determines if file overwrite will be checked.
     MODES <modes string> Sets terminal modes for file transfer.
     PARITY {on | off}  Allows parity quoting if the other end agrees.
     REPEAT {on | off}  Allows repeat quoting if the other end agrees.
     TRACE {on | off} Determines if packets will be logged in a trace file.
     TEXT {on | off}  If on stops adding chars to a file when a  CTRL-Z is
       received.  When off, Binary mode is in effect.
     CHECKTYPE <n> Sets the checksum type.  n may be any of 1, 2 or 3.
       1 is standard, 2 is a double byte and 3 is a crc code.




:Info: server:  Kermit Server Mode
Syntax: server

   This command puts the Multics kermit into server mode.  After executing
this command, the Multics kermit will expect to receive its commands from
the remote computer using special format command packets.  Further terminal
input will be ignored.  Upon execution of a FINISH command at the remote end,
server mode will terminate and Multics kermit will return to the request loop.




:Info:  help:  Kermit Help
Syntax: help [<command>]
        ? [<command>]

   When help is issued without parameters it will print a list of available
   commands.  It may also be issued with the name of a command for a short
   description of the command, its parameters and its actions.  No control
   args are currently supported for the help command.




:Info: show:  Kermit Show Command
Syntax: show [<parameter>]

   When the show command is invoked without any parameters, its default action
   is to display the status of all settable options.

   When it is invoked with a parameter, it will display only that option or
   option group.  Only one parameter is allowed on the show command.

   The parameter may be chosen from:
     SEND, RECEIVE, REC, DELAY, FILE-WARNING, FW, TRACE, DIR, REPEAT,
     PARITY, MODES, TEXT or CHECKTYPE.

     Send, receive and rec yield the current values of the send or receive
     option groups.  Delay is the delay time before sending begins. File-
     warning, or fw, shows whether or not the file warning switch has been
     turned on.  Trace is the status of the trace facility. Dir is the current
     directory.  Parity and repeat show the status of parity and repeat
     switches respectively.  Modes are the terminal modes used for file
     transfer.  Text is the transfer mode for reception.  Checktype is the
     type of checksum to use during transfer.






:Info: status:  Kermit Status Command
Syntax: status

   The status command will print out the name of the last file transferred,
   the total number of packets required to effect the transfer and the
   number of retries that were necessary.




:Info: exec:  Kermit Command Escape Mechanism
Syntax: e <command_line>
        exec <command_line>
        ..<command_line>

   This command passes a command line to the Multics command processor.
   All three versions are equivalent.  The command line does not have
   to be enclosed in quotes.




:Info: send:  Kermit Send Command
Syntax: send <pathname>

   The pathname may be a starname matching multiple segments.  In this case
   they are transferred one at a time.  The target of <pathname> must
   exist.

   If only an entryname is specified, it is assumed to be in the current
   directory, NOT the working directory.

   Kermit will display an OK on the terminal and wait for a preset time
   before sending the first packet.  The delay defaults to 8 seconds, but
   may be changed with the set delay n command.

   Kermit will return to the request loop when all files have been transferred.
   Kermit will also return to the request loop if an unrecoverable error
   occurs during transmission.  Status of the transmission may be observed
   with the status command.




:Info: receive: Kermit Receive Command
Syntax: receive [<pathname>]

   If pathname is not specified, the entryname is taken from info transmitted
   from the source computer.  It will be lower cased and the segment placed
   in the current directory.

   If pathname is specified, it may be any legal Multics pathname.
   If a relative or absolute pathname is specified, it overrides the
   current directory.  If only an entryname is specified it is placed
   in the cureent directory.

   The current directory defaults to the working directory at the time
   kermit was invoked.  It may be changed with the set dir <dir_name> command.

   Kermit will display an OK on the terminal when it is ready to receive a
   file and then wait for the initial packet from the source computer.

   Kermit will return to the request loop on completion of transfer.  More
   than one file may be transferred during one session.  Transmission
   errors may be observed using the status command.
