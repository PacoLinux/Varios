6/16/84  New kermit bugs

The following are known bugs in new_kermit:

CP/M 3.9

.  & characters are changed to f characters.  On Multics side issue the 
   kermit command "set parity on" before uploading files.  3.9A fixes this.



Version 2.0c:

.  When the default check type is changed, the type actually used is not
   reflected properly on the show checktype command.

.  When only an entryname is given on a send command, kermit will look in
   the default directory for the file, not the working directory.

.  When trace is used in server mode, an extra trace file is generated.
